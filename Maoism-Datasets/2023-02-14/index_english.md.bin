[!In France, the fight against pension reform, continues!1](Images/Revolucion Obrera/2023-02-13T11-54-50-05-00/Protestas-Francia.jpg)](https://www.revolucionobrera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Protestas-Francia.jpg)** multitude of Protestants Sesuman from Saint-Nazaire to the day of national strike **(January 19)**, paraprotesar against pension reform. **

In recent days, the French people have been the protagonist of Combative Manifestations in rejection of the pension reform presented in the Parliament by the reactionary president Emmanuel Macron, which consists fundamentally to raise the retirement age of 62 to 64 years. On February 31, February 7 and 11, thousands of workers, students and already retired, took to the streets of the main cities of the country, to protest themselves against the purposes of Macron and the capitalists.

The bourgeoisie and the Macron government are firm in the purpose of affecting the working class with this reform that will lengthen the price time to obtain retirement. Pensions are not a gift or a gift from the capitalists or the bourgeois state. Pensions are salary that the class Oberrera has accumulated for decades, with the sole objective of being able to live one -year -old with an economic income that allows them to subsist during their last years. Private pension funds and the governments of the day that administer the bourgeoisie businesses from the State, seek to affect that entry with a place to recognize a minor amount to the workmen who manage to meet the weeks of work and the age left. And it is only through the direct struggle that can be defended acquired rights and conquer better conditions for retirement.

The fight against pension reform in France is not limited to being a economic fight to defend the income that the working class that has already been expressed for decades of work in the midst of capitalist world exploitation perceives. That is, fundamentally, a political struggle against the state of imperialist capitalists who use all their political-military power violently show the fair protests and manifestations of the workers. That is why it is not enough to resist, it is necessary to organize the revolution.The masses must trust their own struggle to go back to the capitalists to withdraw the pension reform project. They are the diverse forms of direct struggle, the ones that correspond best with the reland of the class struggle towards the direct and violent confrontation of the possessing classes and the dispossessed classes. It is in the streets, that the lameas of the town can build fighting committees that join the people around the fight against the pension reform of the Macron reactionary; But in addition, it is in the midst of the struggle that the revolutionary communists must apply the effervescence of the movement to consolidate and grow the revolutionary political organizations, which guided under the direction of the male Leninism Maoism, manages means of revolutionary violence The political power of exploiters and suppressing the economic causes of capitalist exploitation.

This struggle that today is fought in the streets of France can be an advance of the world proletarian larevolution to the extent that the communists can unite the fighters, organize them in their revolutionary party and mobilize them pollitically to face the political, economic and military power of the capitalists.

A hundred companions and companions participated yesterday in the "Stopping's Well -Well -Bellic escalation" held in the GKN occupied factory.

In the morning there were a series of reports of process political organizations already participating in a previous conference against the Warimperialist war were followed by those of Insormo Bologna, NO Basecolano Committee, Calp Genova and, registered, an intervention by the international meeting Frankfurt for the Trans-National Social Strike.

All the relationships have wondered why at the moment the forces descending the war on a coherently anti -imperialist position and they still clarify too small and not able to

Develop an action that actually contrasts with the participation of Italy and the repercussions in terms of attacks on the living conditions of the Abasse and how to overcome this impasse.

But, everyone repeated with more or less emphasis that it was not task or allegedly claimed to reach a synthesis of the analyzes and proposed indications, nor a more "heavy" form ". The goal that took place was "return" of the effort of analysis and struggle paths made by the Daciascuno, persisted in the "convergence" method, in the perspective that extending and growth of the collective imagination of southern econvergers, each shared in the His ways and places, finally reaches assets of mutual differences and mistrust, change the relationships of strength and fine winning.

With this affirmation of intent and method enunciated by the factory intervention, the discussion was opened to free interventions, in reality, in the afternoon, which ended with the confirmation of the mobilization of mobilizations already announced for the month, the next few weeks, with The goal and hope that the convergence leads to succeed in the month Loseggio, this time perhaps contemporary in the north and south, preceded by a new we insurgent.** The fight against war is the fight against our government that from a part is in continuity with the governments of the masters but it is its fascist nature that does the difference in ideological and repressive terms. **

** On the 25th we will make territorial initiatives. Meanwhile, we are working for a national proletarian assembly on 18th and on this the participant of the GKN initiative were invited **

![](Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-14T04-00-00-00-00/77444655-3801569357.jpeg)For a long time it has been so that men have to attend 'Defense Day'(or that was previously called session). Hvis de ikke gør det kan detresultere i at man får en bøde, og til sidst fængselsstraf. Kvinder bliver istedet blot tilbudt om at møde op, men det har i sidste ende været frivilligtfor dem.

Nu mener dog en række politiske partier at der også skal indføres værnepligtfor kvinder. Både regeringen, Konservative, Dansk Folkeparti, Nye Borgerlige,Radikale Venstre, Socialistisk Folkeparti, Alternativet og endda Enhedslistenstøtter op om denne ide. Det er ret interessant at se alle disse partier somefter sigende skulle have vidt forskellige ideologiske baggrunde, skubbe sammeide.

Hele denne debat opstod efter det nye regeringsgrundlag fra december 2022,hvori der bliver sagt:

» _Som en del af det nye forsvarsforlig ønsker regeringen bl.a. at styrkeværnepligten og at sikre mere ligestilling mellem mænd og kvinder_ _«_ _._

Til ingens overraskelse bliver dette budskab malet til at være et feministiskinitiativ. En ændring der angiveligt vil skabe _mere ligestilling_ i voressamfund. Bourgeoisiet kan ofte give udtryk for denne imperialistiske feminismefor at fremstå som progressive og vinde støtte fra masserne, især kvinderne. Idette tilfælde lader politikerne som om at det er synd for kvinder at deheller ikke kan tvinges ud i militæret. Imperialistisk feminisme har dog ingeninteresse i at stoppe kvindeundertrykkelse og bekæmpe patriarkatet. Det erudelukkende et borgerligt fupnummer brugt til at narre de kvindelige massertil at forsone sig med det imperialistiske bourgeoisi og dermed også detimperialistiske samfund, der opretholder patriarkatet selv.

Hvad der også er interessant er, at ingen af politikerne har givet udtryk forat man kunne fjerne denne _ulighed_ , ved bare at gøre »Forsvarets Dag«frivilligt for mænd også. Men det har den herskende klasse naturligvis ingeninteresse i, især med den militarisering der foregår. Hvad der er vigtigst forregeringen nu, er at få masserne til at acceptere krig og få dem hvervet tilderes reaktionære hær, samt at fylde dem med reaktionær propaganda på»Forsvarets Dag«.

**LET 'S DEVELOPE THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST WORLDWAR PREPARATIONS!**

--DECLARATION--

All the imperialist countries proclaim to be defenders of freedom, democracyand world peace. They all pretext to fight against dictatorships andinternational terrorism. But, indeed, they are the worst te\rrorist dictatorsin the world. They speak about peace but frantically prepare for a new war ofglobal robbery. They strengthen the arms industry. They increase theirarsenals. They mobilize huge war machines mainly towards Eastern Europe. Theysponsor the already prolonged wars against the peoples of Palestine, Syria,Yemen. They are inciting the outbreak of new reactionary wars in the TaiwanStrait, on the Korean peninsula, in the East China Sea, on the Ukrainian-Belarus border, on the sea border between Greece and Turkey. NATO, commandedby Yankee imperialism, in Ukraine through the puppet regime of Kiev, confrontsits mercenary armies, weapons and military chiefs, with the military might ofRussian imperialism. Both sides concoct pretexts to use nuclear weapons. Theinter-imperialist contradictions sharpened to the point that a new nuclearworld war is no longer a latent imperialist danger, but an imminent risk forthe existence of world society and its habitat.

BasicallyThe ongoing proxy wars and trade wars, the emerging trade blocs andmilitary blocks, allotment of heavy military budgets, manufacturing colossaland mass destructive weapons, modernizing military forces and several types ofpreparations for world war even in space shows the neck and neck competitionfor the economic resources and political control over the countries of Asia,Africa and Latin America including several east European countries. All theseindicate the intensifying inter-imperialist contradictions and the scramblefor the re division of markets and world hegemony.But the same economic and social causes that push the imperialists to wars ofrobbery, become unlivable, unbearable material conditions for the slaves ofcapital, material conditions of the rebellion of the exploited proletarians,peoples, nations and countries oppressed by the monopolies and imperialistcountries. And it is up to the International Communist Movement to bring themthe revolutionary conscience, organize and transform the rebellions into arevolutionary struggle against the common enemy: the world capitalist systemof oppression and exploitation.

Com. Mao says that: 'World war may break out and revolutions may occur as aconsequence, or, revolutions may breakout everywhere and while confining itsstrength to with stand them, it may become impossible for imperialism toundertake another world war, whichever way it occurs this is as era ofrevolution'.

It is up to the communists to give an example of internationalist unity andstruggle against the preparations for a new imperialist world carnage; joinand coordinate efforts to promote the revolutionary struggle of theproletarian armies in all countries against the mobilization of troops andweapons for reactionary wars; construct a common front with all therevolutionaries, the anti-imperialist, democratic and environmentalist forcesthat oppose the war and the support and military commitment of the lackeyregimes with their imperialist masters across the world especially in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries; reject and denounce as traitors theopportunist satraps who, in the name of the proletariat and the peoples, givesupport to one of the imperialist factions, when they are all deadly enemiesof the oppressed and exploited of the world; relentlessly support therevolutionary struggle led by genuine Marxist-Leninist-Maoist communists,mainly the people's war in India together with other people's wars inPhilippines,Turkey,Peru, today are the vanguard of the World ProletarianRevolution, against imperialism and its reactionary national watchdogs.

Imperialist capitalism is in crisis!Long live Socialism and Communism!

Or the revolution stops the war or the war unleashes the revolution!

Workers and peoples of the world, unite against imperialism!

** The Irish author Brendan Bean is perhaps little known today, but icy say he was both famous and notorious. **

The poor boy was born in Dublin's working class on February 9, 1923. The mother had two sons from a previous marriage and would also have three more sons and a daughter after Brendan was born. His father was a painter and fought in the Iirian liberation war from 1919 to 1921. At the time of Brendan's birthhouse he in prison for IRA activism.

Both parents were read and politically active. Mora was a personal friend co -raising leader Michael Collins and also took the kids on the literary tour round in Dublin. And it was Collins who was the protagonist when Brendan Behan, who trait -year -old wrote the poem The Laughing Boy.

That same year, he also quit school to become a painter like his father. He also followed in his father's footsteps when it came to politics. Already as eight -year -old he with poems for the journal Fianna, which was published by Fianna Éireann, IRA's children's organization.

#### Borstal Boy

As a sixteen -year -old, he became a member of the IRA, and traveled the same year on his own initiative to Liverpool to blow up a bomb on the harbor. But he was arrested and sentenced to three years in so -called Borstal. The Borstal system of the Distor Britain was youth institutions that were feared of their hard conditions for those who were doomed to be there.

In 1958, this stay was to form the basis for Behas Self -Biography, which the title of The Borstal Boy. We will return to this book later.

In 1942 he was arrested again, this time to participate in planning the drapes of two investigators in the Irish police. Bean was sentenced to fourteen annual prison, but escaped in 1946 when prisoners with IRA affiliation got a general amnesty by the Irish authorities. After 1947, Bean was no longer political active in such a form that he was in some political organization, but both the prison and his political perceptions became central to the poetry. While jail, he wrote his first play, The Landlady, while also authoring short stories and other prose for the literary magazine Envoy. He also had some material published in The Bell, which Varirland's leading literature magazine at the time.

#### Farewell Ireland - Slán ÉireWithout a job and particularly good prospects, he left Ireland for Paris on the time of 1950s. He was already quite alcoholic but managed to survive infrance in a way(Probably by writing pornography for lugubbidskesker, some sources claim)Before returning to Dublin in 1953.

And this time he was to succeed as a writer in his home country. He also became part of the literary community in Ireland, and was assigned both radio and newspapers. The McDaid pub was a base for several of the leading Irish writers, and the hair drawn a lot of inspiration from those he met there.

#### The breakthrough

In 1954, the breakthrough came when he published The Quare Fellow.quare playing probably means something like strange or weird, but also has the under -state "gay", and was about life in prison up to a planned execution of the "The Quare Fellow". In this piece, Bean had a self -evident spirit from his own stays, and although much of the replica exchanges have Engod del satire in it, the theme is grave - what happens to the soul and mind of a person who knows he should be executed? This was a topical problem, since the death penalty was part of the criminal system in both Ireland and the UK when the play came out. 1954 was also the year for the last execution in Ireland, although the death penalty was not formally removed until ten years.

Bean should also win further fame by performing full on TV when Hanbei interviewed about the play of the renowned English journalist Malcolmuggeridge. The short -grown Irish was simply folk. Now he began to write plays in Irish, and an gialt(The Hostage, or hostage, which is called in the translation of the television theater, once again takes its action fralid's shadow side, as an English soldier is captured by the IRA and placed in "Sin's House" along with prostitutes and others who had to be said to represent outouts to the confectionary The larger community.

That same year, the Borstal Boy biography also came out. Here he describes not his only stay at the brutal youth institutions, but also how he did that the Irish Catholic and English Protestant working classes have common interests and must stand together.

#### Ascending fame and inferior healthHe was increasingly full when he performed on both TV and stage, and took a little consideration that the doctors in 1956 had found that he had diabetes. Eventually, he became so bad that he had to read his latest books on bands instead of writing them on the typewriter.

Typically, he would die while he was in the pub. He was only 41 years old when on March 20, 1964, he collapsed at the Harbor Lights pub in his hometown of Dublin. Life was not to be saved, and he was buried with full honors from the IRA and with storm media attention. A short but hectic life was over. The authorship was quantitatively large, but was unrestrained and from the inside of a real -life itself experienced and known on the body most of its short life.

Borstal Boy is released in Norwegian under the title Borstal boy and can be read on the National Library's website: <https://www.nb.no/items/e5ef8e19790D7aa5879798a1c258620?page=0>

In February 1938, one of the most important military episodes of the National Resistance War against Japanese Imperialism gave rise: the Wuhan battle. The 85th anniversary of this event will be fulfilled. In the battle, millions of masses participated directly or indirectly in the contest. Lapartication of the Communist Party of China was key for the Anti -Japanese Front not to be collapsed. President Mao explained in "Prolonged War"(May 1938)that “_e_ _l purpose of the enemy isocupar canton, wu_ _ha_ _n and laonchou and join these three points. To achieve this objective, the enemy will have to use at least 50 divisions, agree with 1,500,000 men, use a year and a half to two years and spend more than l0,000 million yen ”, _ so the defense of the City acquired importance.

At the same time, the anti -fascist struggle in the Spanish Civil War(o Guerranational-Revolutionary as the PCE of José Díaz would characterize it)He was in a key moment. For two years, the popular Spanish masses fought heroically against fascism with thousands of deprovers enlisted in international brigades. Within the large brigadistas number, they were Chinese and Japanese fighting elbow to the Francoist Legionaries, important milestone that is usually forgotten in bourgeois history. President Mao highlighted it:

Some of the Chinese brigades returned to China and transferred the experience of the resistance struggle in Madrid. Others refused to abandon the armed struggle against fascism when international boys(France).

In the defense of Wuhan, the Chinese comrades and colleagues were inspired by LadEfensa in Madrid, a fact that, today, has forgotten the memory of Spanish revolutionary. President Mao explains:

“_ ** In these moments when the defense of Wuhán and other places becoming in an urgent problem, ** It is a very important task to awaken the enthusiasm of the entire army and of the entire people to support the war. There is no doubt that the task of defending Wuhán and other places must seriously proposed and carried out. But the question of whether we can keep security these places does not depend on our subjective desires, but on the concrete conditions. Among these conditions, one of the most important the political mobilization of the entire army and the entire people for Lalucha. If they do not make tenacious efforts to achieve all the conditions, if a single one of them is missing, disasters will be repeated as the loss of nankin and other places. ** Where will Chinese Madrid be? It will be there where the same conditions are achieved as in Madrid. Even savachina has not had any Madrid, and from now on we must strive to create some some **, but it depends entirely on the conditions. And the fundamental of them is the wide political mobilization of the Army and the whole people_ ”

Wuhan ended up being nicknamed "La Madrid del Este"(Madrid in the East). Una de las cancionespopulares entre los soldados fue «¡Defendamos Wuhan!» (Defend Da Wuhan), whose lawyer the following:The song "Let's defend Madrid was also popular!"(Defend Madrid)> _ Lanzad grenades of great explosive power> against Franco, incendiary and murderer. > Álzate, Álzate, Spanish people!> For your home and freedom,> for your independence; > reinforces the front of the fight and> of freedom. > Defend Madrid!> Defend the peace of the whole world!_

> We reproduce a video with a sound recording of both songs:

For his post, the only condition of him makes him corrupt. His only condition of being a media possessor and seizing the labor force of the workers already converts it corrupt. Then, nothing new under the sun.

The problem is that in one way or another this type of "novelties" areutilized by opportunism to distract the attention of class and the lameas in relation to their true tasks and responsibilities for the revolutionary Latin management of society.

For more than two centuries we have been listening to that the rulers steal, that only, murderous, repressive. For that same time we have felt bunny from every calaña have lied and trafficked with the blood and wrestling people.

The masses have been voting since 1830, and the results are always adverse, even with the triumph of their candidates. Why?, Because the elections noticed anything, except make up the old state, print certain reforms that are not very benefiting from the majorities; Because those who govern us, use the state apparatus to satisfy their economic and political aspirations to resolve the contradictions they have between them, among bourgeois bourgeois and bureaucratic bourgeois, nothing more.

What is electoral fraud? And?; The elections themselves are also a fraud; because they make us believe that with them we decided the rumbos of the country and our lives. Nothing more false than that!The same, a hoax. The masses vote because they are alienated, and vote for anterminated candidate because it had a greater capacity to influence - legitimates, by the way - that the people have.

If Lasso is overthrown, it is fine, but another will come, with shoes and t -shirts of another color, they do not matter if it is yellow, red, or even with the colors of Dearcoíris, it will do the same, it will position theirs, it will steal, it will traffic with the one with the one with the one with the one and will not contribute at all to your necessary emancipation.

We have already seen it with Correism, in Peru with Castillo, Morales in Bolivia, Petro in Colombia, nothing changes under the sun with the elections, a loan that will allow us From the dominant classes it will be the revolution of New Democracy, uninterrupted transit alsocialism. Without these purposes, without popular war, we will have nothing.

These days we attend the confrontation of the two factions of the Great Burger. The rags are removed in the sun; The corrupt of the bourgeoisiaburocratic, the thieves, the repressive ones, shout in the face of Lasso, representative of the buying bourgeoisie: thief!, corrupt!, and great sector of the masses obnubilated with that great circus.

The communists do not need a digital press medium, from the ODE Assembly the Prosecutor's Office to know and understand that every regime is corrupt, thief, repressive and murderer; We do not eat story with the "unpolluted" revolutionary discourse of correism, much less from Pachakutik, or that Tibán, Quehpe and others have no responsibilities in the presence of Lasso in the government?, do not say popular unity, other vergacies that pendulate Between a bourgeois Itra looking for a way to accommodate in the bureaucratic apparatus of the state.

Dismissal bells replicate in the Plaza Grande. The opportunists Yalanzan their electoral campaign. Yaku Pérez is promoted, still, does not differentiate in the other political stores, should we fall into that game?

The old state falls apart, it is rotten, infiltrated by drug trafficking and crime; Meanwhile, the "saviors of the homeland" offer the problems that afflict the great majorities, of course, to change the vote, to take ranks for one or gold of the great bourgeoisie.Strategic inflexibility, tactical flexibility, must be the slogan. Broken by the revolution, but not because of the reform. You have to build aUnico, Antielectoro, anti -imperialist and popular, not directed by the usual diminutors, by the contaminated, by the purulent, for those who have fine personalist calculations, but directed by the proletariat, whose last proposites are those who are tight to destruction of the old power-terratema power.

Do not fall into the distractive game presented by the Assembly and the interburger contradictions

Regardless of what happens with the Lasso regime and who happens to him, our responsibility is to fight tirelessly for the conquest of power

Only rights and freedoms are conquered with fights!

There is a "draft", said the commissioner, of an agreement, which should be financed with 70 million euros of public money, and which was the alcentro of the meeting that was held the day before yesterday: as far as we read The "table" was quite full!"At the table, convened by the commissioner Tamajo, the three commissioners of the former Blutec participated(Giuseppe Glorioso, Fabrizio Grasso, Andrea Bucarelli), the regional councilor for work, Nucciaalbano, the manager of the Productive Activities Carmelo Frieditta, the commissioner of the western Zes Sicily Carlo Amenta. Also present present of the regional INPS and the secretaries Fim Fiom and Uilm. "

The meeting was however, urgent, given that the previous agreement had already been already underway, and it also serves to give justification to the layoffs for the approximately 600 ex -remained workers, plus those of the survey. These work of the former Fiat as you know are waiting for 12 years now the phantom anti -industrialization and in the meantime many are reaching the age of retirement, so much so that the councilor, has kept communicating to the present that they have "activated the INPS so that together with the commissioners Check the conditions for the workers, who have the requirements, to the ** early ** ".

In the meeting, the relaunch plan of the Ukrainian company was illustrated, ALUMETA. It is "a 41 million euro investment, including 27 million capitals of its own and 14 of bank financing. Objectively the realization of a production factory of profiles and aluminum components with a 1,100 tons per month. The start -up in operation in 24 months, the first phase is expected to hire 250 workers. "To the Ukrainian masters of the Almeta, the factory makes a throat, also because "Sitrova in the Zes area [Special Economic Area], which means that it can be subjected to subsidized authorization procedures and a favorable tax regime" that is, it collects profits and pays less taxes in general!

But if even in the end the agreement should go through, different remaining remain: first of all for the number of workers, given that there is talk of 250 work, naturally to be "converting", going from the construction of self -aluminum production of aluminum profiles; For the times, which seem long abbastitance ... not forgetting that there are millions of Europe at stake!

But above all, how reliable can a company that is based in Oucraine, a country currently in war?

On all this, on the maneuvers of masters and governments, the workers have now long experience, and also on this proposal they can very well reflect, but above all they can decide _cosa do_!

The recent testimony of the illustrious unknown, Senator Marcos do Val, directly implying Bolsonaro with the coup articulation of the so -called "coup project" does not contribute anything new, but it is another demonstration of Loya widely known. In testimony, the senator said that the former president was with him and the content of the conversation was to carry out a trap to have Alexandre de Moraes and cancel the elections. In the conversation, the former Bolsonarista Daniel Silveira, yes, the bullymism that gave a unique demonstration of courage crying almost all the children's demonstration when he was first arrested for the first time, in February 2021.

No one seriously questions Bolsonaro intended to give a coup d'etat, Yahora saying that he is raining on wet. To discuss the real issue, they do not add these "complaints" -which, by the way, have already passed to the category reported by the sophisticated hammer of the Globo Rede with Susensationalism, with the aim of making the serious military crisis lose dimension and enter the Collective psychology as a matter of unimportant routine, to try to maintain the stability of the old order. Porn talking that Marcos do Val does nothing more than fulfill the role of fisherman enaguas revolts.The heroes of bourgeois democracy, from the top of their palaces and in substantiated editorials, do not drop a comma in protest of the eight years of guardianship imposed by the nation. Luiz Inacio, for example, was distrustful of the military, appointed Tomáspaiva Army commander, the same considered protagonist in the drafting of the Tuit de Eduardovillas-Boas, in 2018. A maneuver that prevented the now president of the publication of running to the elections Presidentials of that year and lomantled illegally for more than a year and a half. Is this how you will end the military intervention, step by step?

It is evident that the military crisis is very serious, and the Secret Military Government is operated from the ACFA, through the protection of the other institutions- it intends The growing recreation of democratic freedoms, in the imposition of its renewed "semi -feudal and semicolonial nation project. The conciliatory, opportunistic and liberal forces cannot and cannot impose resistance. It depends on the working masses themselves, but they can only do so under a co -ondition: they have a bold and consistent direction in which to trust. This is the role and urgent task of the revolutionary forces and the truthful democrats of our country.

![](Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-14T89-00-00-04-00/ομιλια-κωστα.png)_ Read Kostas Bekiari's greeting or watch it in video here: _

** Comrades and comrades, girlfriends and friends **

Talking about a communist like S. Andrea, but also about all great weds who left us with our life and are in the case of communist construction, he does not speak of a toppage. He speaks - mainly - about the present and the future. He reads today, he acts on this and prepares tomorrow.

So this event wants to honor and commemorate the companion, grabbing the red thread of a lifetime dedicated to the race, to stretch ** today, ** on the way to a better ** tomorrow. **

This is not a form of speech. This is an essential issue. A rezeal that - before all - highlights the importance of ** Proper reading ** and the situation in the world. The distinction and the study of contrasts that occur. The analysis of the sides that come in front of. The way these contrasts are manifested. Their perspectives and the perspective they shape.

And not from any point of view. But from the point of view of the working class. The class that produces the wealth of this society. The class that has the potential and the task of showing the way, and to lead the overthrow of barbarism, exploitation and oppression of the social service, for ** tomorrow ** worth in humanity.

So let's look at ** today, ** those with which we are faced with, what we are called upon to confront:

A tough and gloomy today. With the capitalist-imperialist system, which condemns humanity, it continues to surrender to its allocation. Structural crisis, concerning the overall nature and laws of this system. A crisis that tests the ability to reproduce it, a crisis that tests all relationships of which govern, a crisis from which it cannot escape.

On the basis of this crisis lies the character of the capitalist system: the contrast between the socialization of production, on the one hand, and its capitalist ownership, on the other. A contrast that has been huge dimensions and its events are dramatic and at all levels(political, economic, social).

** The war match in Ukraine **(that completes a whole year of tailor and destruction)It is the clearest proof of the Restoration of Entrance to a new, tragically dangerous phase of imperialist stars. The war returns to the heart of Europe, war tension is being closed, and limits and endurance is constantly being tested. Most importantly, none of those involved can and does not want to go back.

The US because they are determined by the need to re -establish sovereignty, their ability to impose themselves, against their resentful failures of their politician, and their relative weakening that generates disputes and impressions.

Russia because it has been openly caused. Because her living space is threatened and her ability to break the climate of suffocating encircling. Because it will mean even greater and upgraded pressures.

And as the confrontation between this dipole culminates, the touches the new limits, the more pressures for the rest of the imperialists, and more for smaller countries and especially the dependent ones like ours.

The nightmare possibility of a third world war and a nuclear -state is not a scenario of some marginal conspirators, but a confessed possibility, confessed by the most formal lips.

** Will the peoples be able to solve? Will the anti -war, anti -imperialist movement be able to block this devastating course? ** We would we want to ask the question a little differently. Not because it suits us because it sounds less unpleasant, but because only so it has meaning to us, to be a guide of action: ** Someone else, beyond peoples and the folk-labor movement to put a barrier to this downhill? Can we We hope for the balances that will form out of each other? ** The answer to the last two questions is a clear and categorical NO. And this produces clear and immediate duties:

-- in every way a complaint of imperialist atrocities in Ukraine. The complaint of American and Russian imperialists, as well as all kinds of corporation involved and contribute to the maintenance of the massacre.

- The establishment of every country of anti-imperialist movements and priests in every country with the demand for all imperialists from Ukraine, but also with the requirement to stop in every way of facilitating them.** The course of the capitalist-imperialist world to this point is a constant confession of its historical bankruptcy. ** Hugeism is constantly expanding. The concentration of immense wealth in the hands of the fiery and the imperialist metropolises is in direct contrast to the inappropriate poverty in which billions of people live. The technological development and the savage amounts spent on it require the destruction and desertification of huge areas of the planet, countries. They bring the destruction of the environment and the exhaustion of the resources.

It is a system that is completely indifferent to human life and demonstrates daily.

Such a proven proof of his frosty indifference to human life was and the way he treated the ** pandemic **. The millions of dead, the outrageous trade game with vaccines and patents, the disclosure of the lack of care systems, as well as the stacking of the factories in order not to slow down capitalist production, are still fresh in our memories. This supposedly almighty system cannot even secure life in the wide folk trees. Even in such extreme conditions of a world alarm, it is fully responsible for pushing peoples to absolute poverty, it was revealed that its only concern is to ensure its seamless obedience, continuing its functioning for special classrooms.

And once again he hid behind the theory of "individual responsibility" in order to remove any trace of responsibility for the birth, management and treatment of the problem.

But also to test methods of dealing with the masses, which could not try undercover. Methods of extreme and violent perpetrators, restrictions and traffic control. Methods that release fascist at a higher level.

** Comrades and Comrades, friends and girlfriends **

Everywhere in the world, this frantic, devastating course of the system is giving birth to races, making the masses to the forefront. From the capitalist metropolises to the region, from Europe to the US America and Asia, the peoples rise, demonstrate, insist, claim. They do not accept the black present and the black future.They will confront the repression but also with the efforts of the east. They will face systemic propaganda, but also of all sorts of managing illusions. They will confront bourgeois forces, but also with the forces of social democracy and reformism. That is, those who do not waste time to sow, even today, illusions for the system of the system, who seek to turn the movement of the mandate into a manageable political size.

** In this constant struggle, the only direction that can continue and perspective on the massive trends of the masses is Communist. ** It is the defense of the class interests of the working class and the widespread strata. It is the emergence of the inexhaustible contrast of labor with capital. It is the construction of real communist parties. Parties that will represent and express its working class and tensors. Parties that will chart the road(At an ideological, political and organizing level)towards the overthrow of capitalist power and the economicism of socialism. Parties that will serve the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism and the case of proletarian internationalism.

** Service of the Communist perspective is the utilization of the synonymous experience of the upheavals that took place in the 19th and 20th century: ** of the Parisian Commune, October, the Chinese Revolution and the BPE, the national liberation movements of the great workers. In our country, the great legacy of the revolutionary KKE, EAM, ELAS and the TSE, the uprising of the Technical University and the anti -dictatorial, anti -imperialist movement and so many other great times of the class and popular struggle.

It is the utilization of the conclusions of the political confrontation that the opening of the global communist movement, the utilization of the line and the analysis of the ML-Light, as part of which was also created by our own organization.** Comrades and comrades, girlfriends and friends **

The defeat of the Communist movement and the opposition to labor and peoples is not a mere affair. Is not something that can be fed or underestimated. ** You need clear and clear interpretations. ** Those who have the class interest to give them. ** And not ** Like these, the system's goodwill gives to cancel the course, the conquering and, above all, the prospect of re -establishing the labor, revolutionary, communist movement.

Only through such, clear, class, interpretations and answers can the working class be re -arranged. Only through them will she realize, not only that ** must ** but also that ** can ** walk her own path.

** Only through them will he repel the fierce propaganda of the system in anything reminiscent of socialist construction and communist. The vulgar, deliberate defamation that likens communism to the fascism(the so -called 'theory of the two ends'), which identifies Communism with oppression and with the aim of bringing out communist symbols, communist ideas and communist organizations in the illegality, as it already happens - during the other "democratic" - Europe.

** Only through such answers, ** The working class will unravel the self -exaggerations and distortions that the reformist -left are cultivated for what is a communist perspective, but also for the History of the Communist Movement itself in order to hide its own states.** With the aim of serving Communist direction in the movement, ** against and against adequacy halls, the KKE(ML)It has been unfolding for years in its efforts to provide answers to critical issues that have highlighted a fierce struggle in our country and internationally, and that concern or need to interfere with the world of struggle, every laborer, popular man and youth that are replies to the collective struggle.

First of all, to illuminate the darkness and to restore the dispersions that have brought about the conditions that followed the defeat of the Communist movement. To reveal the role of reformism and its corrosive influence on the consciousness of the working class. To reflect on the emergence and premium of theories and formations with the most visible characteristics. To project the line of the uninformed troops and the revolutionary perspective, against submission and compliance.

And yet, to highlight aspects of the story that defined the current context in which our people live and move. On the course of the constitution of the Greek state and for the completion of the 100th anniversary of the Asia Minor destruction, to understand the character of the local ruling class and the role of the foreign factor in the region.

This is aimed at the publishing effort of our constantly being blocked. This is contributing to the thematic "schools" of our youth. This is aimed at the publication of our ideological and theoretical magazine "Contrast". But - most importantly - we want our involvement in a daily class struggle to be targeted.

** Comrades and companions, girlfriends and friends **

We have always had the view that the study of the world in which we live, every analysis we do, every finding we end up with, must - before all - be a guide to action in the context of the movement in our own country.

** Here ** that our people find the impasses of the capitalist-imperialist system and their consequences multiplied, with even greater intensity, with even more dramatic tones.

** Here ** that the dependent local ruling class confirms her daily routine in her imperialist bosses. Which has undergone the lives of her people for decades. That has turned the country from end to a cheap shooting range for American -speaking designs, on a huge basis of excess.** Here ** that nationalist crons, juniority and adventurism of the class and its governments alternate with subordination and pending alignment, and translate into profitable businesses for imperialist "patrons".

** In this country, ** Political turmoil in bourgeois political blocked nature and its characteristics in the most characteristic way. »Of the dependency, the symbol of '74.

In this troubled international backdrop and in an area that are judged by top -of -the -line, on each side(The US on the one hand and the EU on the other, but also with efforts by Russia, even taining)It uses ** any means of pressure and control, ** blackmail and threat to a ruling class and its political staff, who base their launch and power at the expense of the people, on the support of the imperialists.

It is useful to reminder these characteristics of the ruling class on the occasion of the pride of the popular Glyburg and the refreshing of many Touros that the kingdom played in the imposition of the interests of the foreign factor.

At the same wavelength and revelations in the espionage case, shown in the most clear way that all urban staff(political, judicial and military), of this deeply dependent system, ** controlled ** on a daily basis, it works on the status of ** daily maintenance ** and ** of constant blackmail. **

And this grid of control, pressures and blackmail ** is not one. ** and some imperialist lecture is exclusively. Each imperialist center has been dying for decades ** his own ** grid, which takes advantage of his ** of his ** interests and ** his own ** purposes. It is a discretion and a cheap election trick to the SYRIZA's attempt to charge a self -made grid exclusively to the Mitsotakis government. It is ash in the eyes of the Tulau and a straight shot in democratic rights and political freedoms, the laundering operation of the action of the intelligence and their rinsing dirty role in the path of modern history here.

All these(and many more we could mention)There are notebooks that highlight the country's dependency status and the people and the working class of this country are called upon to fight.Of the dependency that bourgeois political staff wants to present and ** as his alleged choice, ** as the choice of the right supposed side of the story. Of the side that bloodshed peoples and destroys countries. The seaside, which, among its bloody "successes", has to show off in Iraq, the bombings and the partition of Yugoslavia, the millions of dead and uprooted in the Middle East.

So here's the country, where the urban block is subordinate to the dispersions of imperialist centers and begging them for a sample of a district, such as the coveted upgrading of credit rating or some shipping system(of what is supposed to upgrade the country's defensive), ** The ND government boasts that they are on the side of the "winners." as he had described him.

Only the side of the "winners" does not only have the "bad Putin" against it. The people who are called upon to pay a heavy tax on the impasses of imperialism. The peoples who, under the influence of revolutionary communist ideals, gave hard lessons to Western imperialists, fighting for freedom and independence.

And by the way, this side, the so -called right, is the one who was creating the slaughter that the Ukrainian people were finally drawn and continued to this day.

Therefore, the struggle against imperialism is - ** At the same time, and at the same time, and against the local ruling class. No leisurely for her. And the struggle against the local ruling class and a tuna chapter is a struggle that - slowly or quickly - will find a tourist factor against it.

** There can be no resistance and claim movement on strong bases, unless this issue is clear in its lines. her. Pottings the true nature of the so -called "support packages", which can allegedly manage efficiently. It needs to be reported to be a wide broadness to expand USA.In this sense, ** the reactionary competition ** between the bourgeoisies of Greece and Turkey can only be seen within this context of imperialist enforcement. The "patriotic wind" that is also blowing from the Aegean two -sided, supernatural positions and threats, is not a search for a role in the new geostrategic map that want to be carved in the tumultuous region of the southeastern Mediterranean. From the East and North Africa to the Balkans.

And this is not something that reassures us, but the opposite, ** ** We are. Because the "high -profile" of the American Imperialists, not only cannot exclude a hot episode between the two countries, but it can still cause it - for their own reasons and when their interests are in that they can be made by arrangements and balancers, The bonds of dependency and since the two peoples have paid the price.

The popular factor deficit is really huge in this reform. It is ** a big problem ** that the motto of solidarity and the friendship of the two peoples is not resonated, against the reactionary, adventurous plans of the two bourgeoisie. That nationalist transcendental and chauvinism are found. And it contributes to a significant degree of reformist left, which not only does not separate its position from bourgeois propaganda, but it is already. Let us only remember Tapri "asymmetric threat to Evros" that the KKE secretary was unleashed, parroting and legalizing the whole bourgeoisie.

We consider ** our honor ** as an organization here today the presence of our comrades from our party party, the TKP / ML, the Communist Party of Turkey / Marxist Paleninist. But this presence is also a reminder of the ** obligation, ** ** duty ** that we have as an organization to oppose bourgeois nationalist propaganda. Recognize the philanthropic plans and the destructive policy of the two bourgeoisie. Take initiatives to express and strengthen the friendship and solidarity of the two peoples.So, as we have not expected to date, so we will not wait now. And we will insist on highlighting the need for mass, popular and work mobilization, for the real fronts highlighted by the heavy attack of the system. Like the front of the War in Ukraine and the bastard of our country, which our initiative organization for anti -war anti -imperialist mobilizations in the whole country want to be denounced to complement a year US Secretary of State.

** Comrades and companions, girlfriends and friends **

A critical element in the evolution of class struggle internationally and in our country is a strategic attack on the working class. It is an attack on an ideological, political and organizational level. ** The system knows whom to be afraid of, who is really at risk. **

He wants to ** exploit ** and ** deeper ** the correlation of power he has had at the expense of the working class.

She wants to expand her deconstruction.

First of all, she wants to make her believe that there is no other perspective on humanity, beyond what is defined by capitalism.

To accept fatal and objectively the society of profit and exploitation.

** The system of the system struggles, ** of darkness and widening, to make the working class to depreciate, to distort and delete from its memory the enormous historical steps she took, seeking and claiming her own path, the way to the release of man, the way to equality, the way to the real history of mankind.

** They want to lose all expectations, ** ** to give up ** from every requirement, ** Names are even thought of ** to challenge the dominance of the few over the world.

And most of all, ** she cannot recognize her historical role, ** her dear task to crush the forces of plutocracy, of the rhetoric, imperialism.

They tired her and mocked her as a "shit". Until it disappears!They allegedly replaced its place in production with robots and engines.** the KKE(ML)He knows his sizes very well. ** He knows very well the missing relationships he has with the working class and the difficulties it has. But he is well aware that the approach of labor is a top issue for a political force that wants to be communist.

** the KKE(ML)It is not fooled by its characteristics and its surroundings. ** It is not hidden behind the deconstruction of the working class, to avoid a great and difficult task of approaching it. It does not overflow the concept of working class, confusing it with other layers of workers, as other political forces do, eventually canceling the particular position of society and the revolutionary, pioneering role it must conquer. On the contrary, it wants to route ** in better terms ** approach to the labor class. To give and take from it. To sharpen the classical and taught. To try his line, and to correct it or to enrich it.

** Comrades and comrades, girlfriends and friends **

Within this critical and gloomy juncture, with the war dangers they are naive, with the spectrum of poverty and poverty spreading, and state repression unfolding against any small or large labor and popular struggle, ** The only ones who can answer answer are the work and popular masses. **

** They are the workers ** who see their income disappear and their tomato cannot even cover the basics. Who see their terms of their tendency to get worse. Who live daily in the intensification of terrorism. Who are increasingly measuring victims in the working -class.

** They are all who are increasingly discovering the outlet of the struggle. ** Despite the difficulties and triceps that put enemies of friends.

It is not a proposal of electoral welding, but a proposal ** of racing, ** as a necessity ** for before and after the elections. ** It is not a trick or a light, but the result of the assessment of the rapid negatives and the seriousness of the situation.

** It does not overlook the difficulties ** and does not overcome the disagreements that exist in the left of the left. He is aware of the subjectivisms and the microficults characterize the forces of the Warter, as he knows all sorts of pre -election plans that are being drawn up today until ... October. And it underestimates any of that.

But ** ** ** ** and ** wants ** to fight, ** to exhaust every possibility **, for the widest possible joint action on the critical fronts of the period. ** The anti-war-anti-imperialist struggle ** and promoting the complaint of the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine. ** Palace of the poverty of the people ** and promoting the struggle for increasing salaries that cover the cost of life. ** On the front of state replacement, ** against fascism and defending democratic and trade union rights.

With this perception, ** of joint action ** and ** gathering forces ** against capitalist domination and imperialist barbarism, moved, moves and will continue to move our organization, the KKE(ML).Με αυτήν την αντίληψη θα συνεχίσουν αν κινούνται τα μετωπικά σχήματα στα οποίασυμμετέχει και στηρίζει στους εργαζόμενους και στη νεολαία.

With this perception we took initiatives and highlighted the case of the Hadjidakis Law and its devastating consequences on labor -leveling rights. Against and against the compromised line of the same and reformist trade unionism, as it occurred before, in the midst of the voting of this anti -labor.

But we supported this perception and supporting the struggles that give a habitual order. The struggle of Cosco workers. The struggle of the Staperela Kavala workers. The heroic struggle of Malamatina workers.

With exactly the same perception we entered the youth struggles against an attack on the system and his government. The youth was hit in the squares, the youth found against the university police. The youth for which S. Andreas always had special education.

** With the same perception, and struggling to create better terms, we will be fought. To help to strengthen the labor-acts and to count more and more wins. To repay the people from their imperialists-potential. To serve the case of the revolutionary communist perspective. To make the way to independence and socialism. ** To honor the offer and memory of our partner Andrea. **

** We warmly welcome the 40 years of our KK Brother Brotherhood fight(ML)!**

For the last 40 years it has been a period during which the counter-revolutionary-political-political attacks of imperialism were more intense and effective. With the death of Stalin and later by President Mao, Orevianism was building the restoration and later, in the 1990s, when the mask of socialism was thrown, a period of serious retreat of class struggle began.

The imperialists proclaimed victory over socialism, the working class and workers found themselves in a great ideological siege. The revisionist landscapes not only rejected the principles of the revolution, but they have given all their might of all kinds of poisonous ideas that would hold the peoples in the system and remove them from the true release of liberation. At such a time, the most difficult issue was to be firmly in the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Tutalin and Mao, to defend them and organize the direction for the liberation of the people.

It was only by understanding the developments and historical characteristics of the Progrological Revolution that we could embrace the principles of the Revolution and to deal with the difficulties of retreating class. This also meant the defense of communism. For 40 years, the KKE(ML)It fulfills this historical obligation with strong and steady will. This attitude and will are possible by understanding a lack of and integrated road to the liberation of the peoples. We warmly live this powerful insight.

Comrades, the formation of this will for 40 years is the result of a constant anti -imperialist consciousness, a clear position for Taxi enemies and a powerful transnational perception of the brother -in -law of oppressed peoples. The struggle of the Greek working class and the people's working people can move on the path of revolution, forming a proper consciousness against the rulers and tourism. You enter the forty -year -old with the absence of many men, such as Andreas and Grigoris, who have ensured the establishment and family of this line.Comrades, imperialists have entered a long process of competition and conflict. This is done in the form of a strong struggle for the markets from Eastern Europe to the Balkans, the Middle East, Africa, the Caucasus, the Far Asia, Latin America. We are going through a period during the occasion the regional wars are spreading and conflicts and war in the states become more. Imperialists on the one hand call for wars and on the other with military attacks and interwars reveal the size and acidity of the contradictions. There are large and extensive historical tensions between all states.

Imperialists escalate these contrasts and try to make the excessive countries even more dependent on them. This is still the case between the Greek and the Turkish bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie of Telllada and Turkey, on the one hand, poison the peoples of Middle Ages and, on the other, participate in a struggle to play a functional role in the US-EU and NATO. They do not hesitate to turn our past into military forts of these forces. They are trying to apply their policies in the most effective way, by making enemies with chauvinism.

We Communists are fighting against it, arguing that the people have common interests and a way of liberation.

We are trying to respond to this process, knowing that our enemy oppressed peoples, raised by chauvinism, is a struggle for more dominant classes for more exploitation, to maintain their abnormal system for a longer period of time, and a greater remittance to imperialists. We are aware that the Communists of each one will defeat chauvinism and socialism with a line of struggle that directs the people against their own dominant classes and tourism. Our peoples will realize their common interests, they are just directed towards the right goal and intensify this struggle.Comrades, we are moving into a long -term relationship of solidarity and brotherhood. We are in an effort to broaden and strengthen the struggle of the Turkish people and the Greek people for their common interests against their own bourgeoisie and the imperialists. We have strengthened and reinforced our consciousness to move on with the responsibility of proletarian ethnicism and the relationships we have created.

We welcome you, our companions, who have been the pioneers of the liberationalist of Greek workers and workers and in Greece, who have been deciding the international proletariat in Greece for 40 years. The struggle for the revolution, socialism and communism will end Meniki, fulfilling our leading role in the decisive struggle of our peoples in the Turks and the Greek rulers and imperialism. We are dying the future with the decisive course on the bright path of marxism-Leninism-Maoism.

** Dear comrades and comrades, competitors and competitors, friends and friends **

This event takes place to honor the memory of S. Andreas. A honor that is based on its course, its contribution, the dedication of the life of the communist movement, to the peoples' case.

Dear friends,

We are going through a very difficult time. A period characterized by the most vicious consequences of the dominance of the most reactionary, most aggressive and warrior forces of the capitalist-imperialist system. The consequences that the peoples already exist and the even heavier ones that are being hidden. Consequences concerning the most elementary of their rights and in addition to their own right to life.

Thousands of people who are cut off on the Ukraine fronts and elsewhere are the cost of the methods by which the forces of their searched system. It is the diverse image of the future that we are struck by while they can act unnamed and unmistakably.

Dear friends,

If these developments have their basis and their starting point in nature and the system of the system, its own role has a specific treaty that enabled these forces to act in this way in such a scale. It is the one associated with the defeat of the Labor Revolutionary Communist movement. Of the force of the constituent of the working masses and guidance of their struggle. The power was a barrier to the criminal plans of the system forces. The power that paved the way for the construction of a world of peace, socialism and freedom.

This negative development was the result of an all -out period where forwards were increasingly alternating with movements to the back. The end result was a comprehensive retreat that brought to the first category of those forces that had flagged the conciliation with a system. Which led to the ideological, political and organizational disarmament of the Masses. That caused the decommissioning of a series of fighters.This baton was taken by S. Andreas to hold his steady hands struggling until the end of his life. From a student he made his choice by participating in the occupation of the Technical University. As a Student of Stillines, he chooses the path of racing consistency and defense of the Communist ideals, joining the Thessaloniki PSP and the continuity of the KKE.(ML).

Καθοριστική η συμβολή του στην ανάπτυξη της ΠΠΣΠ και την ανάδειξή της σεσημαντική δύναμη του φοιτητικού κινήματος. Άλλο τόσο η συμβολή του στην πιοπρωτοπόρα μάχη που έδωσε η ΠΠΣΠ Θεσσαλονίκης και την καταλυτική επίδραση πουείχε ο αγώνας της στην κατάργηση του νόμου 815.

Ιδιαίτερης σημασίας η συμβολή του στην πάλη μέσα στις γραμμές της νεολαίας καιτου ΚΚΕ(ML)To defend the communist direction of the organization and the importance of this struggle for the TUKKE reconstruction venture(ML).

Αλλά και στις νέες δύσκολες συνθήκες που ακολούθησαν και παρ' όλες τιςδυσκολίες, όταν ανέλαβε μαζί με τον σύντροφο Γρηγόρη Κωνσταντόπουλο και τονσύντροφο Βασίλη Γεμιστό και άλλους συντρόφους την προσπάθεια συγκρότησηςσχεδόν από το μηδέν της κομματικής Οργάνωσης της Αθήνας. Την ανάδειξή της σεΟργάνωση αξιόμαχη και κομμουνιστική.

Τα όρια ωστόσο των δυνατοτήτων και της διάθεσης προσφοράς του σ. Ανδρέα ήτανευρύτερα. Η συνέπεια, το πολιτικό του κριτήριο, το πνεύμα πρωτοβουλίας που τονχαρακτήριζαν τον ανέδειξαν σε ένα από τα βασικά στηρίγματα της οργάνωσης. ΣανΓραμματέας της κομματικής Οργάνωσης Αθήνας, σαν μέλος του ΚΟ και του ΠΓ καιτελικά σαν Γραμματέας του ΚΚΕ(ML)From 2010 until his death he had a social contribution and a role.Dear friends,

What can and should be said is that the baton was carried by S. Andreas, was carried by a consistently struggling throughout this long -standing journey and until the end of his life. She is the very shell of the young comrades to be in these difficult times.

It is the price they belong to and the debt they have to fulfill.

** Dear Comrades and Comrades, Dear Friends and Friends **

We are at a peculiar gathering. We are neither used to us nor the Left in general in such gatherings, which go back, then go to the future, come to the present and re -do these rounds. The concentration is peculiar because we accompanied the partner three months ago to his last home. We said goodbye to him.

Today, we are addressing another greeting to him and to him to us with technology and through the mind, and very important things have been said by two previous speakers. And especially since the completion of the speech of Comrade, Nikos Papavassiliou. Where there it seems that our movement is not from 40 years ago, nor from the 46 that I say that is TOKKE(ML). Ούτε από την ΟΜΛΕ που είναι ακόμα πιο παλιά. Ούτε από τη ΣΠΑΚ. Ούτεαπό τις τόσες και τόσες Οργανώσεις. Ούτε από την κατοχή και την αντίσταση.Ούτε από τις επαναστάσεις, την Κινέζικη, την Οκτωβριανή. Το κίνημά μας έρχεταιαπό πολύ μακριά και πάει πολύ μακριά. Κι αυτό το ήξερε και ο Αντρέας και τοήξερε πολύ καλά. Κι έκανε μια καλή προσπάθεια και αυτός κι όλοι εσείς που τονσυνοδεύσατε και σας συνόδευσε, για να υπογραμμίσουμε ότι και σήμερα είμαστεεδώ, Αντρέα!Και συνεχίζουμε!

Γιατί αυτό το κίνημα και γενικότερα οι λαοί, αργά ή γρήγορα, ξεσπούν. Ακόμακαι σήμερα, που οι καιροί είναι δύσκολοι, βλέπουμε τα ξεσπάσματα ανά τονκόσμο. Και στη χώρα μας, που σήμερα περνάμε αυτά των δεκαετιών των πέτρινωνχρόνων και ιδιαίτερα του μ-λ κινήματος, του τόσο προβοκαρισμένου και μεδιάφορες υγειονομικές ζώνες γύρω του, προχωράει. Κι έχω τη γνώμη ότι θασυνεχίσει αυτό το προχώρημα γιατί ήθελα να στείλω κι εγώ αυτόν τον χαιρετισμόστον Αντρέα, ότι οι διάδοχοι, οι διάδοχοι, Αντρέα, είναι ακόμη καλύτεροι απόμας. Κι όταν αυτοί που διαδέχονται μία ηγεσία είναι καλύτεροι από τηνπροηγούμενη, τότε μπορούμε να είμαστε με περισσότερη βεβαιότητα ότι ταπράγματα θα πάνε καλά.

** to be well, thanks. **

** "Andrea Vogiatzoglou's pioneering guidance in 40 years(ML)»**

On November 17, 1973, when the bullets thickened and the junta tanks appeared around the Technical University, a group of students who participated in the exaggeration decided to remove the historic building of Patision. When the group arrived almost running enough from someone from the team, he shouted "Oadreas, who is Andreas?" Our companion- student then- Andreasvogiatzoglou had not been removed with them. He had chosen to stay in the area of the Technical University to see, to appreciate, to seek what the uprising could be the continuation of the uprising as the imminent and evacuation of the Technical University was certain ...

** Friends and Friends, Comrades and Comrades, Good evening, Welcome to our Persecution **

We chose to start our speech, with the transfer of this snapshot of us, a competitor from the 1973 pupil team, just long before, at our partner's funeral last October. It is a very characteristic of the drumstick, Andrea. Boldness, perseverance to penetrate and see further, even in the most difficult conditions of the terms of continuing and gaining mass struggle.If this step of the establishment of the Athens Organization was a station at this time it was also a starting point for Andrea's further course. A goal in which Andreas further develops his guidance, the demands he identifies for his organization and self. After all, our partner was deeply convinced and aware of the case in which he dedicated his life, he has no "definitive completion" no "attitudes" and "restarts". This view that he had shaped and conquered from his young years when he said he "read his Chinese" did not only had it on the theoretical and philosophical level. This view of the ever -new demands of the class struggle and these are constantly bringing and producing the struggle for the formation and development of the political communist organization translated it "every moment" into the political "so", in the political duties of the organization, of each sector. , of each partner, and of course on the goals of the mass struggle, stops required by the movement each time. But at the same time, based on this view, the Comrade Andreas also faced the functioning, the terms of compromising and further development of the organization itself. On the basis of this view of this view, he eventually perceived the terms of recruitment, was poured out for members and executives of the organization.

That is why he was a fanatical enemy of the routine, a great warrior and an opponent of perception and practice that did not attempt to take into account any new elements of political and social reality in the meeting, estimates, interventions and action of the organization. So he was constantly saying that "habits exist to overturn", since he was persuaded that what was right or enough yesterday may be a relic or even even today. That is why it was the continuation of a model of vibrant, freshness, search, observation, militancy. And so in every case, we would say at every opportunity. At meetings, and in discussions with comrades. In the demonstrations, in the rallies, in the amphitheater of the cultural events. In meetings and discussions with other organizations.** Friends and Friends, Comrades and Comrades **

With this burden, our partner in the next two decades of the 90s and2000 after the reconstruction of the Athens organization, we would say his leading guiding presence throughout the organization, pioneered battles, fronts, mobilizations and mobilizations. With a single expression we can capture his guidance and action of this period at this time: It was everywhere!

** It was everywhere ** in demonstrations, mobilizations, uprising. On the line, guide of the formation and defense of the blocks, with concern and care for the whole mobilization that existed. Incomplete and militant, it inspired determination against state terrorism, and always on the basis of collective, organized, massive, perseverance and boldness of defense for the unfolding of the struggle against the attacks of the states of state repression.

** It was everywhere ** Claiming and pioneering politically, kinematic and pristactly to continue, continue, expand to gain successes of every smaller and larger resistance, every front of the struggle, the people, the youth.This line and direction was supported and fought with a pioneer and militant our partner Andreas these decades everywhere. From his rigorous role in the struggle of the inhabitants of his neighborhood, Ayonanargiri, for the underground of the suburban, to the political battles of the organization and every front of the struggle that opened in the country. We will skip a time economic economy for many that can be recorded and we will be brought to only three indicative points. ** The first ** is the initiative of Athens- with the recommendation and insistence of Comrade Affairs- to organize solidarity excursions and, in particular, to promote the compensation line in the earthquake-stricken poor strata of the Western Patage after the 1999 earthquake. The batch of backgammon, who played with a sterile out of his scene in one of these excursions, was an authentic expression of our partner's popularity, which with all this organization of the organization next to and together with the effort to develop a degree and the executives of the organization with the real problems, with the blames of the poor and despised world. ** The second ** is that Oadreas is at the forefront of the political battle of abstention from the KKE elections(ML)In 2004, being struck for the first time from cancer not only without any groans and protest but and and knowing it by the members and executives of the organization!** The third ** is not only remembering the hundreds of fighters in the KKE blockbusters(ML)demonstrating in December 2008 in an Athens "reminiscent of" as he himself used to say and many more of them. They all remember Andrea Vogiatzoglou, leading and directing the blocs we are lively and adolescent energy and at the same time with the robustness and decisiveness of the mature and insightful guide.

All these years - and before we pass after - our partner Oadreas, along with his militant, racing and pioneering role, was constantly raising his guiding contribution to the organization.

It is obvious that it is numerous what we could remember about Andrea's role in the context of the organization's processes. We will be enough to have three relevant references that are characteristic of his thinking and the pioneering way of dealing with the issues.Before we move on to the last period of the action of our companion of Andrea Secretary of the organization, we want to refer to a -allow us -"peculiarity" of his contribution to the movement and the organization he served. There are no books, brochures, editions with the signature of our partner!They do not- maybe on his own choice- but the fact is that the partner was very prolific!Hundreds of articles of analysis and direction on the bull -flag, textbooks on party instruments, texts and accounts in party conferences and highlights, guidance decisions, pioneering elaborations and elaborations by 2000 In co -organizing with TKP/ml and other organizations from abroad and country, it has been his own over the years. We also definitely want to be named the juicy and public comments that he wrote for a whole period in the column "In the MS ..." of our newspaper and of course his important political texts of his recent years. We are referring to the decisions. For international developments in the face of and after the election of Trump in the US and what it expresses and signals, and in the decisions of the KO. For the Karadina-Caradine that our partner from the first to literally evaluated with political-class fullness against the great confusion and closing of adaptation on our "left" as he said. KO He has already decided to correct this "peculiarity" by issuing our partner's texts.

** Dear Comrades and Comrades, friends and girlfriends **

On the basis of this route decades, on the basis of these terms that he had shared with his struggle and his guiding offer, the Comrade of the KKE is elected secretary of the KKE.(ML)At the 7th Conference of 2010, two next conferences of the organization in 2015 and 2019 and from this place passed away on October 18, 2022. The 12 -year period was as we all know the most troubled, wild, demanding and dive period from Transition until today.On the basis of this profound awareness of the state of the movement and the configuration it had formed, it had no trace of illusion about the policies of the system in front of the influential popular anger. Persistently wrote and suggested before the 8th Conference of 2015 that _ "Even the system is called upon the system because it has lost the ability to effectively control the masses even in front of the ballot boxes to interfere with with proximations that want to be presented and rehabilitated, a way to tow this kind to right and conservative directions' _

At the same time, however, our partner and as secretary of the organization at this time was aware that the answers required in the greats of the movement, the mass struggle, the left would be built and constituted on the basis of the current terms and conditions of class and political struggle. Stood and struggled with the perception that the KKE(ML)He has and has made a greater responsibility and role in the case of the struggle of the masses and in shaping the prospect of this struggle. On this basis of a subordinate and struggled for the organization and with the organization it was raised on two interrelated axes:In the context of these axes and demands, the companion offered the "frontal resonance" proposal submitted by the KKE KKE.(ML)In October 2011. Based on this proposal, Comrade Onceas was just boldly and decisively as in the case of the fighting warrior, fought for the establishment of L-AA in front of the obvious and populist necessity for the establishment of a kinematic tool that would compete in the line. With LA-AAS we also fought the battle from the 2015 referendum. And he was again Andreas, and despite the great pressures of the days, he suggested and formed the position of abstention from this referendum, a position that he expressed politically one. world of the left and which was justified dramatically in less than 24 hours!

During these 12 years that have been accumulated and multiplied by the requirements and needs produced by the resignation and defeat of the many previous decades, Comrade Andreas had a basic concern.

The formation of the terms of continuity and upgrades politically, organizational and organizational of the organization **. That is why he supported **, favored, promoted, events and efforts to study the history of the Communist movement and the causes of the restoration and defeat, on the basis of the inheritance already formed for the organization in this chapter and with the pursuit of this inheritance to enrich but to enrich but and be conquered by a broader Dudent. ** That is why ** He was in every way struggling for the emergence of young men and shaped and shaped terms for a more collective leadership of the organization. In addition, however, he sought and sought to comply with the development of the organization the formulation of the political strategic characteristic for the alliances of the working class in the country and in the region of which can establish the re -establishment of a revolutionary communist movement and party. And this is not because, of course, it was overwhelmed by the necessity of setting up the working class in order for itself because it approached this necessary class in dialectical by forming and considering the political subject of the revolution.** Comrades/Oh, Girlfriends/The **

It is a given and obvious that Andrea's life is an integral part of the KKE's lack and struggle(ML)and in particular the course of the organization by its reconstruction in 1982. That is why the assessment of our co -hostel offer is an integral part of the overall valuation of these 40 years of the course, the struggle, the conquests that our organization shaped. In this context and background Andreas Vogiatzoglou "belongs", he served and he relied on it and became himself. That is why it is clear that this overall valuation can not be done today- we will close this speech by attempting to see its offer within this total journey of 40 years after the KKE reconstruction(ML).

Μέσα λοιπόν σε αυτές τις τέσσερις δεκαετίες θα ξεχωρίζαμε τρία από τα βασικάστοιχεία της ιδεολογικοπολιτικής ταυτότητας που συγκρότησε και διαμόρφωσε τοΚΚΕ(ML)and which are the foundations of its existence.But even today when imperialist atrocities and capitalist barbarism, those regarded as radical approaches appear to "explain" developments with the acronym of Tina. In the "best" - we do so - that is, they admit that they cannot have an analysis of the taeters and the terms that shape the current situation. But- even more so- the complaint of the Arctic has been made to repeat the same devastating illusions even in today's conditions. That is to say again that there is a "alternative" for workers and peoples within this world ...

** Second ** Starting with the defense of the revolutionary communist construction and the historical unprecedented conquests that it gave to the 20th century we raised the issue of capitalist Paulinism. born of a political setting that "had no" social basis. In stark contrast to the rationales that advocate communism as a specific, given social "model" whose formation is therefore a matter of "recipe" and "exclusively" issue of the development of productive forces. In complete confrontation with the rationales that present the restoration as a "law -abiding ending" of the "power structures" of socialist society, the rationalist that mourn ... unconventional and anti -authoritatively the vulgar anti -communism and the power of the capitalist system. ****** Third is the issue ** of support in our own strengths. This concerns all the social and political forces of the revolution. The proletariat and thelands. The revolutionary communist forces and parties. And concerns them the issues and levels referring to their formation and growth struggle and the formation of their revolutionary perspective. With their mark forces, all of them, without loans and borrowing and without being "aid" by the opponent, will set up their steps and their ponies. They will shape their own answers that will serve their own interests and their prospects in the theoretical, ideological, political, organizational level. Only in this way can their existence and their own be independent from the requirements and terms of the system. Only in this way will their plans and aspirations be under the heresy and approval of a toypal, will not be used by the system and political forces. And this position applies even more as an inviolable prerequisite are planned and sought movements and choices that want to relieve contrasts in the system camp. Then it is even more forced to have the forces below to have a substance, to have conquered the independent terms, to have their own strong correlation. Otherwise the plans of utilizing and exploiting their opposition is in fact the opposite of what they proclaim . They are fractured behind foreign flags, tail designs and subjugation.

This position, to rely on our own strengths, is founded on the two issues, as we have previously exposed.

** _ Why _ ** The characteristics and impasses of the system are such as they do not predict "help" or at least "tolerance" in the forces that want to stand and confront it. Not only in today's period has changed every period and circumstances.

** _ Why _ ** And on the issue of the struggle to build socialism, of course ... "outdoor help"!It is the working class, the youth and the people, it is the Communist Party of the Revolution that forces that invite their pioneering struggle not to allow the backlash, to continue in the revolution, on the road of deep and spreading everywhere in the prolonged democracy as already attempted and already attempted. Bep!With these key elements of our 40 -year -old route was Comrade Andreasvogiatzoglou. More correctly, ** These were ** Andreas Vogiatzoglou!In the formation and conquering these basic elements, his own decisive contribution was. Based on them he fought in the movement and within the people. These were processed, estimates, political directions and pride.

And being deeply convinced of the first two, Andreas was particularly special for the third. She was struggling with passion to say to "discover" all her strengths and abilities. Expand them and multiply. This was not an organizational issue for Andrea. It was a political issue above all that required hierarchies, choices, initiatives, overcoming forms that do not help to realize the phase that is the case of the struggle to re -establish the revolutionary communist movement and party.

This was the road that Andreas was crowded to serve more decisively and effectively the decision made in 1982 by Vassilis Samaras, Stelios Aagoutoglou, Elias Kamaretsos, Grigoris Constantopoulos and Aykkasparian. The "decision of the 5" as we call it in the language of the organization, to go to the current. A decision that over the years and on the basis of those that our organization has conquered us, its value and its importance. A decision that - in Mao's words - shaped and shapes the successors. A decision that is our own today, the executives and members of the organization and on the basis of the data that has now been formed calls us to decisively confirm our delays and weaknesses.

** Girlfriends, Comrades/The **

We do not want to "idealize" to present another "another" Andreavogiatzoglou outside and beyond the one who really existed. We do not lack the emotional charge for the guide, the partner, the friend, we have lived for so many years and so close. But we are aware of that communist organizations and mass struggle are not not relying on false representations.For these real reasons for us it is debt and the need of the struggle to honor the memory of our partner Andrea Vogiatzoglou. Together with him is our debt and our need to honor the memory of the other guides we have lost in previous years. Basil, Elias Kamaretsos, Gregory Constantopoulos and Stefanokaramitro, who each left his own great footprint, the pioneering contribution to the struggle for the liberation of man, the exploitation of the exploitation, It gives birth to the capitalist-imperialist system.

We are well aware that the real honor in all these comrades is to continue with determination and self -denial on the road they have fought. That is why the reference we have attempted today to our coincidence is not a retrospective of memories of a "yesterday" that has passed and fled. It is highlighting the conquests of the KKE(ML)On the 40 -year -old route from his reconstruction. It is highlighting the terms that the KKE(ML)He has shaped the duties he puts on to continue his struggle. It is the responsibility we incite before all the working class, the people and the youth for the advancement of this struggle.

** Glory and honor to Comrade Andrea Vogiatzoglou!**

** Our comrades, Andreas, Vasilis, Elias, Grigoris, Stefanos!**

# Confluence of the struggles so that the people do not continue paying the crisis

![](Images/Partido Communista Revolucionario/2023-02-14T99-00-00-04-00/FNC-.jpg)** 1. ** ** Earthquake in Syria and Turkey **

On February 6, a great earthquake ravaged regions of Turkey and Syria, leaving modern thousands of deaths. As expressed by the statement of our party, "we express our most fervent solidarity with the Kurdish, Sirio Yturco peoples for the tragedy suffered" and denounce the corruption in the construction by the Turkish fascist Erdogan and the fratricidal civil war in Syria, which aggravates these catastrophes Natural.

A week after one year after the Russian imperialist invasion of Ukraine, and in the middle of the hard winter, the war gets worse and more. Now a counteroffensive to recover the land lost in Donbás and Enel Sur of Ukraine. They are adding 500 thousand men to combat. More than 300 thousand are already transferring the Ukrainian border. They broke into the Donbás, the region that integrates the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, annexed by Moscow, next to the two in the south: Gerson and Zaporiyia.

Ukraine awaits the weapons promised by the United States and other powers. It needs time to form their troops in the management of tanks and other weapons that would enter the coming months.

The invasion of Russian imperialism against Ukraine is aggravated, Russia Deucrania!Outside the United States and NATO!Solidarity with the patriotic struggle of the Ukrainian people!

** 2. ** ** More imperialist dispute and more popular struggles **

President Yanqui Biden said a few days ago(7/2), that "we have the lowest employment rate in 50 years." But it does not say that, in the world, more than 150,000 employees, based on the United States, have disappeared in recent months. It is a hard economic blow to Silicon Valley, the technological center of United States.

In a world where the economic crisis progresses, the imperialist dispute over global hegemony is aggravated. The powers discharge the crisis on the oppressed countries and on the workers and the people of their countries. French remains moved by the massiveness of the strikes and mobilizations against Macron's government intention to adjust retirement. Amazon workmen star in their first and historical strike in the in -enaglate. They ask for a 50% increase and the employer offers 5%.When the "Chinese spy balloons" aggravates the crisis between Yankee elimperialism and Chinese imperialism. With the new agreements made by the Yankees in the Philippines their submarines will have access to their bases in Elmar de la China. These bases are on the main island of Luzón -the Masacontinental Filipina closer to Taiwan -, where the United States already has two bases and another will be on the island of Palawan, in front of the islas.(A set of islands in dispute in which the armadachina has been moving). Esa zona es un cóctel inflamable al que cualquier chispa puedehacer estallar.

Las superpotencias imperialistas llevan así a los pueblos de los paísesoprimidos a ser carne de cañón en sus disputas.

América Latina sigue recorrida por un reguero de luchas en el marco de lacreciente disputa de los imperialismos asociados a uno u otro sector de lasclases dominantes de cada país.

La rebelión del pueblo peruano sigue en las calles y rutas. Reclama larenuncia de la presidenta impuesta por el golpe de Estado, marchar a nuevaselecciones y abrir un proceso para una nueva Constitución. Mientras, elgobierno y la mayoría fascista del Congreso se niega y continúa con una brutalrepresión que ya lleva más de 60 asesinados.

Lula se entrevistó con Biden, y afirmó: “Lo diré fuerte y claro, Bolsonaropreparó el golpe y todavía sigue intentándolo”.

Lasso, el presidente derechista de Ecuador, recibió un duro golpe en laselecciones: perdió en los principales estados y la oposición se perfila paralos comicios de 2025.

Estados Unidos sigue avanzando en acuerdo con el gobierno de Paraguay paracontrolar la llamada hidrovía Paraguay-Paraná, con la pantalla de que latecnología se construye en Taiwán.

En el Atlántico Sur los yanquis y sus socios ingleses han montado en nuestrasIslas Malvinas la base militar más poderosa de la región. La armada chinainunda con sus pesqueros el Atlántico Sur (many of which are spy military ships)and negotiates to build a logistics port on Delphame land that was already approved by the government of that province.

The imperialist dispute and the growth of the hazards of war dye regional and national political.

** 3. ** ** The penalties are of us, the vaquitas are alien **The salaries drag the ax that Macri imposed them and continued to fall. The guilds are fed up with "ceilings" and to continue losing the race to the inflation. The precarious workers lost 30% compared to inflation.

According to INDEC, the basic basket is $ 152,515. The minimum retirement will be $ 73,665 as of March, an increase whose percentage will be applied for universal assignment for son and family assignments. While millions that do not charge any social plan, follow the campaign to comment and prosecute social organizations.

Faced with the murder attempt by Lautaro Nahuel Ardura, delegate of ATE de Lapampa, the National Government and the Provincial must guarantee the security of the Company and have a rapid investigation and punishment for the aggressor. The threat of death to Sebastián Saldaña, leader of the CCC of Santa Fe must also quickly testify. More than five years have passed the attempted murder of our partner Julia Rosales, and the cause is still stopped. This corrupt judicial apparatus is only at the service of the ruling classes.

Rural workers and peasants are very beaten by drought. The heat of heat caused more fires, in many parts, caused. There are spotlights in Tierra del Fuego, La Pampa, Buenos Aires and Corrientes. And new foci were registered in the Paraná Delta.

In many cities, as in CABA and Greater Buenos Aires, there were light cuts in thousands of homes, again showing the negotiated of the great electric companies, which continue to increase the rates.

We are in the middle of ** a brutal adjustment ** to those below, and a handful determining and imperialist monopolies continue to gather with a shovel what the national work of national work.

As Atahualpa Yupanqui said: **

** 4. ** ** Advance the confluence of the struggles **With the internal elections in La Pampa, together for change(JXC)He showed its Divisions and their fights, which can only be understood based on the fact that, behind each "group" or "figure", there are different sectors of imperialist landowners and monopolies. This week, "Lilita" Carrió joined the list of presidential decandidates.

The center of the dispute is the presidential candidacy. But it needs, for the Congress, the territorial deployment of the UCR, its governors, deputies and senators. Also its mayors.

In fact, the PRO is divided between the sector headed by Macri, where Patricia Bullrich and María Eugenia Vidal are also as candidates; and the director directed by Rodríguez Larreta. In radicalism they are Gerardomorales candidates - Governor of Jujuy - and the neurologist Facundo Manes. There are several projects in which JXC is already broken, others that negotiate to try to break the break and some in which JXC disappeared.

Despite this situation, they express a sector of the thread of the ruling classes that maintains the expectation of winning the presidential elections, and thus propose adjustment and delivery. They are proposed to end labish conquests, further adjust retirees, a tax reform that offers the crisis down and repression and jail for those who oppose.

They, who have mortgaged the future of the homeland for one hundred years, are outraged by the claims of the town while defending those who are taking them into a shovel. A sample of that is the brutal media campaign they are doing with white in the native peoples in front of their righteous we hope.

That in a country where the earth is increasing as Clarín discusses the future of our homeland **. We directed the main blow of popular lalucha. **

The government's policy is dyed by disputes between Cristina Kirchner, Alberto Fernández and Sergio Massa. These three sectors hold the agreement with the IMF that imposes a brutal adjustment, yield national sovereignty and are of popular and national claims. This divides the Popular and embarrassing field that reactionary right.We understand that today it is essential to expand the unity to deepen the work for popular emergencies and in defense of our sovereignty in Laschalles, and from there create the conditions to discuss the issues I defend in the front of all. For this debate, our PCR has a proposal 10 measures, which we are taking to the factories, neighborhoods and the movements that we integrate. Only in this way can we defeat that right -handed in the presidential elections.

** 5. ** ** The struggles grow **

When this number goes out to the street, 15/2, thousands of poor peasants and peasants of the National Peasant Federation make a national day to fight by clarifying the declaration of “productive emergency” and urgent measures for the sector. They mobilized throughout the country, accompanied by the CCC, which conflues with their own claims, and other popular organizations.

That same day, in the Federal Court of Mercedes, the CCC is mobilized by its leader Myrian Carballo, claiming the cessation of judicial persecution to Myrian and popular movements.

The retirees and pensioners of the MIJP-CCC march on 24/2 throughout the country, increasing increases in the amount of minimum retirement, without bonds. In addition, they mobilize to make the pension moratorium effective, since there are near 800 thousand people who are in danger of not being able to retire.

Mobilization and claim grows in many unions, to achieve non -roofing increases and for large companies and banks, a part of the so -called “income tax” paid by thousands of detributors and registered workers are charged.

The immense women's movement of Argentina prepares a great day of the Hucha for March 8, International Day of Working Women.

A few days after the start of classes, millions of boys cannot buy useful sneakers, it is urgent that the national government, the provincial and municipal deliver school kits to guarantee access to the ATODAS school and all the boys.

For some, 2023 is just an election year. We put the center teach at the head of all the struggles for popular emergencies, national obese and the validity of our conquests and democratic freedoms, and from there we offer a struggle in the PCR and the JCR, to advance in the path of liberation National and social of our Patria.Four years after our beloved Otto Vargas, we remember a great national day of painted and activities of the PCR and its JCR entod the country. We continue his legacy in the defense of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and follow the struggle for the National and Social Liberation Revolution, to end the landowner and the imperialist dependence that oppress us.

Rondônia, February 2023

The slaughter committed by the Special Operations Battalion(Bope)On the 28th Dejano in the region of the district of Nova Mutum Paraná, rural area of Porto Velho, resulted in arbitrary arrest and torture of at least 3 peasants of the Campim dos Santos Area, and one was wounded to the shoulder, and another 2 Camponeses, The comrades stretched and manduvá, tortured and murdered.

The peasants stretched(Rodrigo Hawerroth)and mandruvá(Raniel Barbosalaurindo)They were not in possession of any weapons, they were surrendered by the police and then without any chance of defense were submitted brutal and later cowardly. The brands of the companions of the companions leave no doubt of the cruelty to which they have been subed, both bodies had many bruises, consistently consistent with weapons and beating, perforations for the body, including nosolhos, in addition to the mate Rodrigo tongue and the duasextremity of the ripped mouth by cutting object.

Together with this ignominious crime, other Military Police troops, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pontes, made attacks on the family sakers near BR 364, firing and throwing bombs toward them, stealing and destroying their belongings and performing arbitrary eilegal, repression and your eviction.

All this to defend the privileges and illegal interests of the LatifundiárioAntônio Martins dos Santos, the old Rooster, famous thief of public land of the union, reported numerous times and the target of different operations of the Federal Public Ministry. It was to defend the bandit Old Rooster, Gill, Thief Deterras, Chief of Armed Band(formed almost always by police officers)and Assassinode Peasants, that the PM of Governor Colonel Marcos Rocha, Pau Mandado Dolatifundio, has committed successive crimes against the peasants of this region.And in the face of all this, the press monopolies(G1 G1)and Aimpons(Rondoniaovivo among others), as always the role of spokespersons of the bandit police and the landlord. They silence such serious overcreases or merely repeat the lying version of the mercenary, alleging armed confrontation, gunfire, always seek and demonize peasants in struggle for land as the worst, so absurdly justify the practice of abuses, astray and summary executions.

Just a little honesty, just have eyes to see in a simple asphotic look that show in what situation the bodies of the stretched companions Emandruvá were presented, mutilated and already lifeless, to confirm that they were brutally tortured and murdered with cold blood and that Poor version is no more blatant and cynical scam to hide, once again, the fact of the facts.

Until when this troop of killers, from old state uniforms, will continue to impunity torture and killing of peasants?

Regarding the governor of the landlords of the landlords, the other Rondônia Popolitics, the police mercenaries and much of the state's judiciary, the Union Land Roads, and their armed bumps, the national press monopolies and the Derondônia Garbage Press, All the same scoundrel, and abundantly funded with public resources, will be perpetuated until they are swept by the revolution in the country.

But as long as it is not enough, they are wrong if they think they can follow committing to impunity crimes without response. As much as they seek to apply state eterror repression in order to block the peasant struggle, while a handful of parasitic landowners protected by the old state is the largest amount of land in this country, and on the other hand millions of poor landless peasants or with Little land, the struggle for the revolutionary, by land for those who work in it, will continue increasingly; And the blood of our companions will be avenged, we will respond with the sameviolence, can tell as certain!The blood of our people poured out in the struggle drowns it but watering our cause, makes our flags even redder, increases our class hatred, our firmness and determination to fight. The risk that runs the stick, runs the ax!We are doing the math and you will pay it!** Honor and glory to companions(as)Fallen in the fight for the land!**

** Punishment for the executors and principals of the Murder of Fighters of the Popovo!**

** Out of our areas, police avoidance of land thieves from the land of the union!**

** The lands of Tiago dos Santos are from the people!**

** Conquer the earth!Destroy the landlord!**

** Live the agrarian revolution!**
