"An important and necessary assembly that can be considered the first Assembly specifically of the workers who have taken the floor; workers have already entered into action through the struggles that make Mache have strongly placed through this assembly the need to thin, extend these Lotte by connecting, joining other workers, workers who fight or who still do not struggle but would like to organize themselves, against the attacks that are suffered by masters and deigvern who represent them and which inevitably intertwine with the more general laconus of women's life. If all struggle struggles, make every fight the struggle of all, this is the real and concrete message to the other workers and workers.

** This assembly of workers, who do not delegate, who take their organization in Loromani as workers and as women, who affirm the autonomy of women so that their direct protagonism is real, ** is a novelty in the class union landscape and in Movement of theonnas, an important stage of a path started for about two years with the experience of the Women /Workers 'Shareholders' Meeting.

**(We announce that the next Assembly Women/Workers National Workers in Formatlematics will take place on February 23 at 5pm, at 0dg above all Lapreparation of March 8 of the proletarian women)**

Today this road is all the more necessary in the face of the new Meloni Nerogoverno of the most reactionary right of the bourgeoisie in power.

The struggle of the workers of Beretta _(started for several months, up to the most recent on February 1st)_ Increase other workers and concerns right -term rights of working women, the right to maternity, all -sizes, against the discrimination that also exploit the dimmigrated condition of these workers, to impose worse working conditions, dislation, Serie A and Serie B workers, too, too if they do the same job.

The workers' assembly also sets on the plate the question of the march in most proletarian women, workers, workers, that is, women who organize themselves and fight, even if these struggles start from aspects that are immediate - the salary, the hours, the hours, the Health and safety -they are close to the whole condition that concerns us comedian, and therefore inevitably there is an intertwining between the work that we do the factory and the care work that is downloaded to us totally out of the factory, in the family.

So this extra gear is necessary, in particular in this phase, to percontract the government of the owners who took office and which has different issues on the agenda, against workers' struggles, against immigrants, in the general trend of the bourgeoisie to modern fascism , that diavising in the attack on proletarian women, the workers to be exploited more in the factory for the profit of the capitalist masters. Only for Fareun Centno, one of the ministries, the Mise, the Ministry of Economic Development, is in the Ministry of Companies, that is, declaredly at the service of the Dedadroni(in a nationalist and corporate sense); While there will be the Ministry of Family, born, equal opportunities. But which family, birth rate, equal opportunity, if the workers are attached in basic rights such as Lamaternity, while on the other side they prepare to attack the abortion/ iliDitto to the freedom of choice of us women?

We don't have to stay sun, this is what the masters want, that moreover and oppress us always tend to divide us, isolate us, to put the others, weaken us, suffocate the struggles, repress them in any formal questioning their production, that is, that of the profit cheli enriches.

So this assembly that starts from the struggle of the workers of Beretta Ditrezzo, is not alone, therefore, of Trezzo, is an assembly that concerns us all.

** \-- Central Committee, Proletarian Party of Purbo Bangla(East Bengal proletarian party -PBS/Bangladesh)  (March, 2021)**  (Republished in revised and extended form by CC, June 2021)Proletarian Party of Purbo Bangla(East Bengal proletarian party - Pobis)wasfounded 50  years ago, on June 3rd, 1971, with the leadership of the then leader and thefounder of the  party, Comrade Siraj Sikder(SS). That was the period of Liberation War ofEast Bengal  against the national oppressor state of Pakistan. The then main bourgeoisparty Awami League  fled to india, leaving people helpless under the genocide of Pakistanigenocide. Before that, at  the eve of genocide, their main leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman surrendered tothe Pakistanis.  Other leaders, exploiting the movement, struggle, sacrifice abd self-dedication of the people,  sold the country to India, for their own self-interest of power, while fleeingthere.  At that time, Maoists, as a newly risen force, despite their various politicaland  sujective weaknesses, stuck out for the people in danger. Contrary to fakeIndian-Awami  liberation war, they waged an actual/revolutionary war of liberation invarious parts of the  country. Siraj Sikder, the founder of our party, in a situation of absence ofpower, organizing a  revolutionary army at Peyarabagan area in Barishal, created a short-livedliberated area. There  he founded the "Proletarian Party" on June 3\. Earlier during Pakistani rule,he founded "East  Bengal Workers' Movement" as a preparatory organisation for founding a partyof its kind. He  transformed it into the Shorbohara Party, a proletarian party, in the middleof the sound of  shelling of cannon in 1971.  As we are celebrating 50th anniversary of founding of the party today, we must

3  agriculture basically remained semi-feudal, centering which the huge changesmust be  comprehended.  Due to the above-mentioned things, vast development of communication system,  mobile, IT, military technology, technology in general, and the tremendousstrengthening of  centralised state machinery, has presented the military questions in verydifferent ways than  before; the solution of which is not yet complete. Only through consistent andcumbersome  practice of peoples war in various countries can these problems be overcome.Principle and  strategies of war and struggle must be developed. Carbon copies of previousstruggles would  not work. Although the only way this is possible, is by making country sidesthe base, making  peasants the major force, sticking to the principle of protracted people's war-- not in any  other way.  We must be conscious about the changes in the national and internationalsituation.  Since there is no socialist country any more in the world, there are threebasic contradictions  active worldwide. Among them, the contradiction between imperialism andoppressed nations  and people is the principal one. Inter-imperialist contradiction is showinghints of a bi-polar  world once again. On one hand, there is US-led imperialists and their allies,and on the other,  Chinese social imperialism, Russian imperialism, the the forces led by them.It is exavatating  the crisis in them. As a result, people's struggle against imperialism andtheir various policies  and their war mongerings is rising up in various countries of the world.Imperialists and their  agents are resorting to fascism to avoid the crises. They are immenselyexpanding their  preparations for war. All of these are emphasising the significance of guidingpeople's struggle  according to correct ideology, programs and path. Subjective ability of ourMLM forces are  trailing behind the objective revolutionary situations. We must increase ourefforts manifolds  in order to reduce the difference by developing revolutionary party, struggle,and people's war.  * Our tasks must be clear on the occassion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of  the party and of people's war. Which are:(1)Forming a single Maoist party ofa new type by  uniting all the dedicated Maoists;(2)building a successful people's war with the leadership of this party;(3)organising and uniting huge number of people in various vividorganisations and  fronts; and(4)creating a new 'International' of maoists worldwide. The basisof these tasks  would be a qualitatively higher ideological-political line, and military andinternational line.  Regarding these important tasks, we, all the leaders, ranks, supporters andpeople must  move forward towards greater struggle. And must keep working for materializingthe dream of  all revolutionaries. They must continue doing so until the end, until the lastbreathe. They must  be always prepared for self-dedication, for sacrifice of any kind, for servingthe people. And  for that, they must grasp Marxism-Leninism-Maoism more deeply. They mustentirely  dedicate themselves to the struggle for the liberation of the proletariat andoppressed people all  over the world.

# PC February 6 - Like the school for the reactionary Meloni/Valditara government, it must be increasingly at the service of the trend/march of the bourgeoisie in power to modern fascism

A little girl in Palermo days ago was urgently brought to the emergency room, a state of serious hypothermia because many schools in this city as well as all of Sicily and in many other regions of the south of this country do not have functioning iriscaldications and children, the students are Forced to be included with scarves, hats, jackets to die from the cold and in particular these days with somewhat low temperatures, but many schools are absolutely not adequate inhabitants such as school or inexusive structures with small classes, without gyms, canteens, hygienicinon services a Norma ...



All this continues "normally" to happen while the more than reactionario -minister Valditara from its black armchair of gold launches proclamations and advertisements on the progenet/school to which it aspires, and could not do differently precisely by ideologically and politically as part of the Governomeloni:

As a servant of the servants of the system of the masters/capital to which the school must be increasingly functional, Minister Valditara has announced "" "Public awarding lack funding that could come from the private ...", other than allocation of public money for public school, indeed that one must cut because today they must serve the masters and the militaria expenses in the support/participation increasingly active in the interimperialist war. But here it is not only a mere economic question of funding for funding, but a specific idiological/political question arises that falls within the 'Meloni government's perspective that must be free to hand to the masters/companies to continue making profit and even school must be aligned in this regard.

Here Valditara speaks of "corporate professionals" in class, of "sponsorships" for private individuals, of "synergies with the production system", while with the school sizing provided with the Budget Law2023. Within two years, there is a risk of the closure of about 700 schools and especially in the southern regions with the serious risk of heavy to the jobs of all school staff and not only precarious, while in the maneuver they are allocated 70 million euros more In 2023 private to the institutes, compared to the 550 already allocated by the Draghi government.



But that's not enough!



The Council of Ministers unanimously approved, as a preliminary, the law of the law written by Roberto Calderoli/Lega to accelerate towards the laregiondonalization/differentiated autonomy, outlining the frame within which Leregioni will be able to obtain the transfer of the functions and skills for specific areas such as the Healthcare, school, the environment ...



The commission of jurists in the report presented to the bicameral of fiscal and the regions on this issue has reported "... the autonomy of the unit would be shattered by the unitary system of education, undermining alaradice law and freedom of teaching(Artt. 3, 33 e 34 cost.), subordinating the school to the regional political-cultural address and ** to the local businesses **. ** PCTO routes, the Degliadulti Education and the higher technique and the indicators to evaluate the studies would also decisive at a territorial level, with projects increasingly linked to local production, **(ed.

The member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine(Pflp)told _Al-Resalah_ that, "Betting on the Biden administrationwill not give us more than extra losses." Thirty years of peace talks under USpatronage has been a waste of time, she added. "Washington does not haveallies, it only has people and states which serve its interests."

Khaled made her comments after a meeting between Palestinian Authority leaderMahmoud Abbas and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ramallah, and thedisclosure of an American plan proposed to Abbas that aimed to "abort"Palestinian resistance.

"The US administration will not stop illegal Israeli settlements, will notcancel its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the state, will not stopmaintaining Israel's arms superiority in the region and will not stop itsunlimited support for Israel."

The PFLP official reiterated the importance of resuming the internalPalestinian reconciliation process based on the outcomes of the comprehensivenational dialogue led by the secretaries-general of the Palestinian factions,reactivating legitimate resistance and supporting Palestinians everywhere.However, concluded Khaled, Palestinian unity cannot be achieved without a"clear comprehension" of partnership based on democratic rules.

“And we are also Brazilians, and we too

We are revolutionaries, and we are also

martyrs(https://anovademocracia.com.br...)The blood of men's slaves is

brother of the blood of the slaves of the peoples, both

fall on the face of the tormentors, both cry

revenge on the arm of the future ”(Castro Alves, Gonzaga or the Revolution of Minas, 1867).

Pode-se dizer, sobre a literatura brasileira, e talvez mesmo sobre toda aliteratura latino-americana, que da forma violadora dos senhores nasceu asubstancial contestação dos subalternos. A devassa da Inconfidência Mineirateve significados econômicos e políticos claros, mas, culturalmente, refletiutambém esta realidade. Buscava-se ali arrasar não apenas os fulgoresrevolucionários, mas também a terra fértil de uma intelectualidade nacionalcom aspirações burguesas incipientes, descritas em versos tanto quanto emdiscursos e cartas conspirativas. Esta colocação, porém, não contempla aindafielmente o processo muito mais violento, nos tempos coloniais, imposto contraos povos autóctones e os povos forçosamente transmigrados para asterrasbrasileiras sob o jugo da escravidão. No caso destes, é muito mais exataa exposição fanoniana que define a violência cultural do colonizador como umengessamento e mumificação, desvalorização e exotização das manifestações não-ocidentais de visão de mundo e correspondentes expressões ideológicaseartísticas (FANON, 2018). O indianismo romântico da Iracema de José deAlencar (not for nothing considered by the academic tradition as the father Doromance Nacional)In our literary history, it is the culmination of this propriety, on the one hand. The figure of Castro Alves, however, imposes, at the time and a prototypical and emblematic form, such as the internal and external denial of the project, as the necessary stone in the middle of the way, which does not move to the Docaminho and eventually becomes part of it, But at the same time, it makes it a problem to be considered by fatigued retins - and also, which is more important, by the lush. This condition of problem, far beyond the aspects and descriptive, is the very nature of the transformations that occurred Brazilian Naliteratura in historical modernity, mainly.

Not so surprisingly, the incomplete, but not episodic, transformation of colony into a nation(the great semicolonial nation that still exists)It has its turning point more or less close to persecution, sometimes caricatured, that seems the nineteenth and early twentieth century, of an identity in literature. Brazilian National Opproblem, in this regard, is confused with the problemaliterário in the philosophical and political plane. We question ourselves on the one hand: We are a national pool, but is the nation suitable for the colonial/semi-colonialde content of our economy? And on the other: the national literary system has been consolidated, but can we say that its national content is in agreement with its form or Édela, somehow, the reason? Likewise, the form imposed by the executing and repressor violence seeks to announce the actual content to suppress his revolta, the revolt of those who are their direct creators or their interprets. Of the performic and pedantic pounds and hyperboles, in general, a folding and part of the arcadism to satirical and challenging scores of the first phase of modernism, there is always the attempt to say the earth, in this sense, there is an obvious _continuum that should not be forgotten . But there is also a pronounced contradiction, a contradiction that can be diluted, as the contradiction between idealism and omaterialism, but also between deism and subjectivism and collectivism(reticent deform). Desde o primeiro comentário de Pero Vaz de Caminha sobre osindígenas e os autos do padre José de Anchieta à descrição do Frei Franciscodo Rosário, comentada por Antonio Candido (1999)of pineapple as a fruit to the divine will, deism is evident; Subjectivism is classical as Romanticism, as best evidenced by its second generation, emulating of the evil generation of the century; Subjectivism and collectivism are competing forces in modernism, as we demonstrate, of the Ladosubjectivist, the psychologism of some Lispector's works and tales and, from the Ladocoletist, the grammatical transgression of Mário de Andrade, the political poetry of Drummond, the translation of culture and language As a regional phenomenon in Guimarães Rosa, social criticism and populism in Jorge Amado etc [1]. Even Lispector's Baby, however, it is necessary to be seriously scoring, it brings into itself the feminine condition in society, transcending the subjectivism romantic disability.The colonialist and imperialist clay giant sought to impose hisesthetic, but phonetic matter, semantic interface, interpretation, asintaxe, all that is human, social and psychic, insisted on seeing, even if in agony, freedom In literature, in analogous motion to the diverse regional struggles, riots and revolts that jumps into the history of Brazil throughout Latin America. Proof of this is the linguistic differentiation between our language and that spoken in Portugal. They are the same and other, in as many aspects as we want to tell. Father José de Anchietafoi the first to face this otherness, still in the 16th century, seeking to promote, in the best of his conditions, a cultural meeting with the indigenous, a transcultation, in fact, never concluded-inverted by Heitor Villa-Lobos, in his Bachianas, in which he sees in the continuous movements of our musical Expression an impression of the European(CARPENTIER, 1971)-, produced grammar of Tupi, which would provide the material for the formation of the Brazilian Language, the general language, as well as texts in Tupi. The “illustrated draft” Marquês de Pombal was responsible for prohibiting the language. In the sad end of Polycarp Lent, we see the character mainly the problematic of this language amid the nationalist arrishes proposedly caricatures and often frustrating. The writing itself Delima Barreto, in this and other works, is an aesthetic challenge, sometimes under grammatical challenge, the conceptions of vetusian scholarship and the names very currently still of the Parnassianism and allClassical tradition.

Lima Barreto, a much more marginal, much more universal premodernist, than the vast majority of picturesque writers of the first phase of this school, seems to challenge the reader to face the new status of the nation in front of the world and especially in front of itself. His writing is the great announcer of a time as much as of a people. Although it does not like, in life, to have his mackered to Machado de Assis, there is a great coincidence between the works of authors, which is also contradictory, and justifies a certain common doletor charm: both give voice to the city, deeper to the transformations Occurred in the middle of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century in the urban overseas geographical scenario, specifically in Rio de Janeiro. The importance of this is in place the exotic and ideal whole of Indianism and go to the concrete parts dopaís, a movement developed better within naturalism, in a way, but finds in Machado its most recognizable voice(at least in terms of a lot of capital)and in Lima Barreto, heir to this tradition, his most critical or more congruent voice, until the second phase of modernism. In the first, we find the exaltation, even if acidic, of city life, an impeccable performance of all the elements that make up the existence of carioca developer in the midst of action, drama and comedy. In the second, agent is subtly demonstrated, when he raises, for example, in a brief passage of the sad end, the condition of a lady, Maria Rita, who had undergone being slave after the abolition, to whom she is attributed “longing” To serve, since his life is one of someone who has not passed, to whom he was denied his own life, and who is asked to sing songs from the time of scrape, asked by a member of the family who had it, in Bairrobenfica.

Another key point for understanding Lima Barreto's gaze on aurbanization is the fixed idea of Lent of becoming a peasant and showing the Ariqueza of the Earth, as well as to transform the agrarian situation of the country. Oquixote Carioca, which ends his days shot in the same city from which he left, defending the dignity of the prisoners of the Armada revolt and criticizing the government that had sought to support in the name of nationality, the homeland under construction, “heroic” dorepublicanism, is very lucid to point out , in full boiling of the Draconian projects of organization of misery in urban spaces, the accentuation of the land issue and agrarian production, the properly agrarian condition of our country. Not long before the writing of the book and anxiously in the period in which it takes place, it would arise, as a result of the agrarian crisis, the first favela, in the Morro do Livramento.If it is impossible to deny that, in response to what we point out at the beginning of the texts about the particular situation of the cultural expression of the indigenous peoples and historically enslaved, Lima Barreto seeks to develop much deeper criticism in memories of the clerk Isaiah Caminha, an attitude that costs him and the reputation, the attitude, the attitude, costs and reputation. May their meditations properly become more concrete in their chronicles and newspaper articles, we must, as well as admit the strength of the sad end. This is, of course, partly because Fatodesta is his biggest work, but equally, and especially, by the metalanguage that he has not only the history of Brazilian literature, his formation, his ways and misleading, but the mocking prophecy of his Renewal, as well as the universality of your theme. The invention of the Brazilian novel Porlima Barreto is, otherwise, by the invention, in our country, the novel that Senega to be novel, that is, that it refuses to seek to be above the classes, political confrontations, social seizures. No wonder the catharsis of polycarpoquaresma occurs the moment he clashes with the cruelty and cowardice contracts the miserable and mixed people.

This great journey has not yet found, nor will it only find in the pure, its end. It is a fruit of the history of the people, which goes around with substantial and formal lines precisely precisely when we pass from ocholonial to semicolonial, when exploitation and violence become clear tantomal in consciousness. Brazilian literature, in general, has been known significantly and reached great apex in many of our authors, before and especially after Lima Barreto, but it still remains to be created about the cornerstone of a Castro Alves, over the first -sided framework of a Lent with the Lent with Fatherland, which makes him in a Brazilian, as the first pages of the book announce, yes, but in a Brazilian vitable to go beyond the inheritance of the colonial rubble, we still have to build, we say, a literature of the Brazilian people, as weapon, Ideological preparation and front of combat against formalist imposition and cultural oenges.

1 If we wanted to draw continental parallels with collectivism, we could also refer, for example, to Garcia Márquez's magical historiography in a hundred years of loneliness and Neruda's sociological and geographical epic in its general corner. Neruda, in fact, is the maximum transgressor of the epic genre, creates a mythology that is indeed an anthropology, their heroes are the result of the people, the blessing they receive is the history of their struggles, rise from the ground replenished and refuse Giving up on the pugna against the colonialist and imperialist chimera. N'as grapes and the wind is still in pair with Maiakovski, makes the story a proletarian struggle, from Russia to China, in the culmination of the history of Humanity, revealing in the meek smile of Mao TStung the impact on the revolution

We document an unofficial translation of a news from the Solrojista website about the Mexican State and its lacquer's intensified oppression of the popular opposition to the major imperialist projects.

![](Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-06T15-19-03-00-00/collage_agresiones_istmo.jpeg)The war against the people is intensified and the activities of the old large landowner bureaucratic state are concentrated on the workers and the people who resist. Trods of all the self -proclaimed 'fourth transformation' after the arrest of AFovidio Guzmán, the trial against Genaro García Luna or the events of the Metro Imexico City, is the truth that the regime's most important effort is to surround, isolate, contain, criminalize, and destroy the popular movement left wing.

If we look briefly at the latest events in the country, in addition to the recent militarization of the subway from the National Guard, we can get a clearer image. In Michoacán, comrades Ricardo Lagunes Gasca and Antonio Díazvalcia, the former a democratic lawyer and the latter are a social leader who was visible at the head of the opposition to the mining project "Las Encinas", disappeared.

In the Tehuantepec-Ishmussen, several assaults were recorded less than 15 days; The first was the arbitrary arrest of David Hernández Salazar Frabinniza 'de Puente Madera in San Blas Atempa Municipality; On January 17, DavidArrestrested by investigators in TehuantePec was brought to the Tanivet prison, where he was released a few hours later to have opposite the sight of an industrial area in connection with the Interocean Corridorved Tehuantepec-Athmus(Ciit). Den anden årsag var chikanen mod ejidatariosog medlemmer af lokalsamfundet i den nordlige del af Isthmus, som blokeredejernbanesporene efter at have bortvist arbejdere fra den virksomhed, derudfører CIIT-byggeriet.

Som gengældelse ankom elementer af den mexicanske flåde den 26. januar for atforsøge at skræmme befolkningen, hvilket førte til nye protester og til, atflere bønder ankom og intensiverede kampen.

I går, den 29. januar, trængte bevæbnede mænd på 10 pickup-biler ind ikommunen Rincón Tagolaba i Tehuantepec, rev adgangskæderne til kommunen,husenes stolper og hegn ned, skød i luften og satte ild til befolkningensejendomme. Lejemorderen »Tacho« Canasta og hans bror Sergio Gutiérrez stod ispidsen for angriberne, som uretmæssigt tilegnede sig titlen »Komissariat« iSanta Cruz Tagolaba; deres mål var at skræmme befolkningen for at overtagekommunens jord og forhandle med CIIT. Mange timer senere ankom en operationfra nationalgarden efter klager fra offentligemenneskerettighedsorganisationer, men angriberne var allerede taget afsted oghavde taget beviserne for det væbnede overfald med sig.

# PC February 6 - Stellantis Melfi, the cry of the assembly workers: &#8220; we go too fast, close to collapse &#8221; -

More and more workers who denounce an unsustainable situation. "Ilmix doesn't work, we're less and we work more. When you come home you're a rag, you just have to throw yourself on the bed"

![FCA-Satamelfi](Images/proletari comunisti/2023-02-06T15-33-00-01-00/fca-sata-melfi-27285.660x368.jpg)'We are so fast that from the slab they cannot provide us with lecsche that we need to work. And so on Thursday we were notified, a few hours earlier, that on Friday we would not have worked because they were missing icomponents. "Thus begins the long and heartfelt appeal of one of the many operating operating operations denounces a situation now close to the" collapse ". Ilprimo Bluff, a Feeling stronger voices, consists of the new work called mix. "To lighten the task - explains UNLAVORATOR - since last year there should be machines in sequence, 500, Renegade and Compass, but in reality, often missing pieces, you are trenini car expanses In sequence and you have to do more operations in the same days at the first ".

[](https://www.outbrain.com/what-is/default/it)This is because, he adds another 'dead tired' worker, "in the domains had the staff on the line, but practically the same car is produced with an setting always greater than 400 cars in turn". A kind of damn about the damned would become the assembly. "By now they have prompted the production - adds the same worker - that worse you cannot say. If you complain, you also take the warnings, heads Ute Ereparto are also on the graticola and they command you to do exactly that says Stellantis, otherwise they also risk them too ". Another worker, who has always been to assembly, raises his shoulders: "I don't remember in the past, if you are trained, if you are trained, you can be just behind the position, but when you come home you don't help, you just have to read. That they don't make it. Just this week they had two others where I work, but the production is almost unchanged ".

For those who do not make it, there is always the "CDS", or worse, the spectrum of the "dismissal". In front of such a "worse" situation, it is given to where the union is. The widespread opinion now seems to be to be: "I am now with the company, what it asks for their accepting, signing, and then send us only the routine messages to us". EANCORA: "They are completely prone to the logic Stellantis for which you have to produce more with less workers. They must spend less". A real circle of the damned, we said, would become the only Stellantis line of S. Nicola di Melfi. A bolt where only those who are most trained resists. Perhaps the theme should seriously be able to seriously in the appropriate secretariats.

_We publish a call for a rally in Hamburg that was sent to us, and after the recent events I was sent an addition of the "Alliance against Imperialist aggression" after the recent events. About the events in Mexico and Brazil have published us information from the comrades on site: [here](https://www.demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/42-nachrichten/lateinamerika/7461-uebersetzung-massaker-in-nova-mutum-ro-neue-berichte-denunzieren-folterungen-und-verletzungen-der-rechte-waehrend-des-angriffs-der-militaerpolizeials-ausdruck-des-proletarischen-internationalismus-aus-solidaritaet-zu-dem-kampf-des-brasilianischen-volkes-u)and here](https://www.demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/42-nachrichten/lateinamerika/7456-mitteilung-nach-der-aggression-gegen-rincon-tagolaba-tehuantepec)._

Aktualisierung:

Inzwischen erreichten uns Nachrichten von einem erneuten Massaker an armenBauern im brasilianischen Bundesstaat Rondonia, wieder einmal angerichtet vonden lokalen Großgrundbesitzern. Die "Liga der armen Bauern" (LCP)Fights in the region for a piece of land for all arms and rural farmers from whom you can provide yourself and your families. Again and again there are massacres through the Brazilian state, the large landowners and henchmen. We therefore call all friends of the Brazilian people and Derlcp to take part in the rally and re -denounce this murders!

End to the criminalization of the struggle for ground!

** rally: Wednesday, February 8, 2023 | 6pm | S-Bahn station Sternschanze **

* * *

In the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, the poor farmers have been defending themselves against mega projects since the old state has been building in cooperation with Den imperialists. The farmers are robbed of their land so that huge wind farms can be pulled up on the Isthmus von Tehuantepec. In this way, Diebauer is expropriated, nature is destroyed and the population is expelled.

The resistance, which the farmers have been providing for years, is answered by the Altenmexican state and its henchmen with repression and terrorist. In order to break the struggle of the farmers and the different popular movements that have taken on the task of developing resistance to die -pericalist mega projects, the state rushes to the population. This situation has drastically intensified in the last weeks. Several fighters of the people were arrested or disappeared without a trace. On January 29, 2023, armed paramilitaries occupied the municipality of Rincon TagolaBedholten the residents, destroyed cultivation areas and drinking water hoses and gifts for intimidating. The national police arrived, but did nothing against the heavily armed paramilitaries.

The Mexican state uses the killer gangs to work for him, which works for him at the expense of the people at the expense of the people at the ISTHMUS Vontehuantepec and every means is right for them. Our solidarity gilt the fighting poor farmers and the popular movements, such as the people's flow red sun(Red Sun People's Current)that fights tirelessly unwinds for the needs and interests of the people. We demand the release of all imprisoned fighter of the people. We demand dieso -future lively presentation of the disappeared. We are calling for an end to the repression and terror of the old Mexican state and its hand.

The twodrops expose the cowardly and terrorist acting in this which is the third attack on the occupation in 2020.

The brutal attack on peasant families occurred during an operating operation at the headquarters of Norbrasil Farm. Three Battalions of the PMDeslocated on 01/28 with dozens of vehicles and drones. The reactionary reactionary troops shot three peasants, physically assaulted more peasants, and stole the individual belongings of the peasants. Workers of the workers died after torture. Marcos Rocha, Governor Doestado, is denounced by LCP for positioning himself alongside the land landowners. The peasant movement also states that the operation was to stop the "privileges and illegal interests of the old Rooster."

The macabre slaughter perpetrated by the killer PM of Governor Colonel Marcosrocha took place in the area of the area of Tiago Campin dos Santos, located on Fazendarco-Íris and Norbrasil. According to Abrapo, the alleged owner of those lands is the company Leme Employment, by the landlord Antônio Martins. "Rooster Velho", as he is known in the region, is quoted in the "White Book of land grabbing" as one of the largest land grabbers in the country, is being investigated by the police and federal, in conjunction with the Public Prosecution Service, by the financing of dishonors in the region for land grabbing and expulsion of peasants.

The day before, the hundreds of families, who totaled more than 300 campones, occupied the headquarters of Norbrasil Farm, which is on the edge of BR-364. The interest in occupying that portion of land was shared not only these 100 families, but by all From the area Tiago Campin dos Santos because the alternative to reaching the houses is taking a walk of over 100 km. In addition to this, that portion of land is the main point for draining theocamponian production, due to the proximity to the federal highway.

_A ** Urgent appeal to solidarity ** from workers to subly tenders Khuene+Nagel of the Iveco group, to the Nudm National Assembly in Turin_

_ _



** Intervention of the Si Cobas union representative of Turin **

Good afternoon to all and to all. They are the union representative of the Sicobas in Turin and work through a cooperative in subly tenders of thekhuene+Nagel of the Iveco group.

Listening to everything that has been said from the other tables, in addition to Quelloche I heard, I participated, I thought about how in the factory everyone Igioti there is a concentrate of all these problems. I have heard diviolence in all its nuances: discrimination, exploitation, precariousness, unemployment. In our department, each round is massacring, in addition to the carichids work that ruin health even psychophysical, there is also oppressive leaders, who tell workers, even screaming sometimes, to raise the production rhythm, also using insulting words to submit Dignityedelle people with the blackmail of letters of recall and dismissal. Often they were verbal has no real foundation, but it is needed to create a discontent climate. We live this situation very badly we women's women.

An example would be just a few weeks ago, when the owners made the assemblies and have practically separated the male female department department. Also because in the situation in which we find ourselves, with layoff procedure, 15 women will be fired, those crims, which, as I repeat, are also given by the hard work that we have done, but also by some very bad disease, which perhaps exceeded. The garments have this type of attitude also to divide Ilavoratori, to find, in one way or another, the way not to unite them then strike. However, they made this assembly saying to men "rest assured, for you there will be work" and they have excluded women this situation. After a few weeks they made another assembly, also bringing the CGIL and CISL, however, not even worrying that the slorage of the members is of the SI Cobas, to convince the workers to agree the compromise of the good exits and abandon the struggle for the work of work in the New logistics pole of San Mauro, which we have been carrying out for 6 months. Also for these reasons we have made strikes, including the last of 2 January, with a garrison of fighting the gates of Iveco, with all the nosricolleghi men who have still supported us and are solidarity.

Iveco is a large financial capital industry, but it is also a factory produces trucks, armored vehicles. Unfortunately we are in war and Noinella Fabbrica also have workers who come from Questionesi of Russia, Ukraine and Eastern countries. We are with elavorators from all over the world, with the populations of Ukraine and Russia. We are also with women contrary to war, women, mothers, Ukrainian deisoldi sisters. Also for these reasons of solidarity we make the strike, not only for the economic claims on everything, the defense of the dilapery place, the wage, the dignity as people, the income of citizenship, the right to the home.

We need your solidarity, let's organize ourselves together for 8marzo!Because it will also be a great day of struggle in the factories, preparing assemblies with workers and workers to bring out the harsh working and life conditions and understand how to oppose the concrete results, with what practices of struggle, starting from also that of 8 March.

We workers are there and we also wait for your hand, because Iveco's Lavertence is a crucial point.

On this Tuesday, February 7, 15 workers will be fired. Some at risk of dismissal are mono -parent workers with full -load figliminors, risking to end up in the middle of the road with their children, for the increase in prices, especially of the house and shopping.

For all these reasons there is a great need to act now, immediately, with strong, not only union but political action, in many people who struggle this state of affairs to change it; The workplace must have everyone and everyone claims our dignity. We are, let's organize together, we are waiting for you.

Hard struggle without fear!

On January 29, two landowners and a group of gunmen attacked peasant accommodation Rincón Tagolaba, in the city of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. Attentive of intimidation promoted by the paramilitaries involved the destruction of work structures and firearm shots at the dosble houses. Despite the immediate complaints of the residents, the National Guard only served in the community after the exit of the gunmen. The community receives a lot of Mexican and international organizations and promised more organization and combative mobilization as a response.

The attack began when Sergio Gutiérrez Garcia and Anastacio Gutiérrezgarcia, Latifundia and heads of paramilitary flocks in the region, invaded the community of Rincón Tagolaba accompanied by a group armed dentileiros. During the robbery, the gang knocked down posts and fences of work and destroyed hoses to transport drinking water and access to the community. Still as part of the reactionary attack, Ogrupho surrounded and shot the homes of the peasants, especially the asdos community representatives. In all, the action lasted around five hours.

By the time the attack began, the peasants notified the Oaxaca State Dogovernment Secretariat, the Oaxaca State Attorney General, Oaxaca People's Rights Adefensoria and the national mechanism for protection of defenders and journalists. Despite the immediate warning and length of the gunmen's attack, there was no response during the hassle by the institutions of the old Mexican state.

The first sign of the old Mexican state in the region took place with the arrival of the National Guard - a force commonly used in the repression of the country's depamps - in Rincon Tagolaba. According to the witnesses, the car came in the region minutes after the end of the attack and departure of the suchlymakers, who still had time to collect the capsules of the projects discouraged against the houses of the residents.

** Old Mexican state was conniving with successive attacks of peasant gunmen **

The attack on 01/29 was not the first performed by the García brothers against Rincon Tagolaba community, nor against the peasants of the region withhuantepec or the state of Oaxaca. According to the Current of the People - Red Sun(CP-SV), popular movement with strong performance in Oaxaca, the brothers are bunch of paramilitary gang known as Cartel do Dousing, a group that operates naregion under the latifundium, imperialist companies and different levels of the Mexican state for the purpose of expelling peasant communities owners to give place The construction of megaprojects in the region.In September 2022, Mexico's own opportunistic president, André Manuelópez Obrador, accused the brothers García of performing attacks against peasants in Tehuantepec. Nevertheless, Sergio García is also a docomissari president of commuting goods in the Santa Cruz Tagolaba region.

On July 31, 2022, Sergio Garcia invaded the community of Rincontagolaba accompanied by a flock of gunmen. At the time, the Latifundiáriotinha is the objective of imposing Luís López Zárate, a criminal known in the region, as his replacement in the position of the Commissioner. The attempt was rejected by the Capanese, who knew Zárate's history. Garcia then threatened the osmors stating that she would return to the region. The fact was denounced to the Oaxaca State Attorney General, who did not take counterattacks.

Three months later, in Santa Cruz Tagolaba(region in which the Garcia brothers have four criminal proceedings moved against them), two CP-SV activists, Jesús Martínez and Érick Sánchez, [were shot with firearm gun]](https://anovademocracia.com.br/noticias/18328-mexico-dois-ativistas-assassinados-pela-pistolagem). Jesús Martínez foi assassinado no ato, enquanto Èrick Sánchez foihospitalizado. Na ocasião, a CP-SV acusou os irmãos García de terem maquinadoa morte dos dois ativistas como parte de uma “estratégia de contrainsurgênciado velho Estado para impor políticas e governos antipovo, bem comomegaprojetos imperialistas de despejo e morte”.

No dia 17/01, 12 dias antes do recente ataque, elementos desconhecidos foramavistados derrubando árvores na área da comunidade de Rincón Tagolaba. Osindivíduos foram abordados pelos camponeses e admitiram estarem ali a serviçode Sérgio Gutiérrez Garcia, que teria ordenado a liberação de 100 hectares daterra na região. O bando foi expulso da comunidade pelos camponeses e amadeira extraída foi mantida pela comunidade.

![](Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-06T97-00-00-04-00/nosokomio-xanthi.jpg)It has long been known that the dismantling of prone care is methodically evolving through the under -staffing of the Hospital in the Prefecture of Xanthi and in the beautiful prefectures. We mention only a few of our city's shortcomings to understand the size of the problem. For almost 2 years the hospital has no ICU(Intensive Care Unit), has no mature('Just' because the last doctor died), only three anesthesiologists have been left, the urological clinic is on call half the days of the month, the outpatient clinics for many specialties are either overwhelmed or closed, and the list is not over.

The Pathology Clinic has been in a marginal condition. Hospital -intensified work rates, the outrageous indifference of the Hospital Administration for the problems that the hospital has long faced, have been led by a series of specialists. Thus, there are only two specialist physicians left, with what he is self -styled to the people of the city. The doctors are watching almost day after day, while passing through their hands dozens of people on a daily basis.

All this means that in our county the care of popular people is caring. The patient to go to the hospital will be treated by a exhausted doctor, an exhausted nurse(Why are the repo and licenses given by the dropper)And in the end he will be forced to address a private doctor, paid, because he will not find a number of specialties available in the hospital.

The direction of hitting the right to care is not just about our own. It concerns all the country's hospitals(see Ierapetra, Rethymnon, Giannitsa etc). Έχει ξεκινήσει εδώ και χρόνια από τις προηγούμενεςκυβερνήσεις, συνεχίζεται με τη σημερινή και θα συνεχιστεί με την επόμενη.Είναι η κατεύθυνση της ερημοποίησης των νοσοκομείων με στόχο την κατάργηση τηςπλήρους και δωρεάν περίθαλψης για όλο το λαό. Η επίθεση που δέχεται ο τόποςμας μέσω της υποστελέχωσης του νοσοκομείου και της υποβάθμισης της παρεχόμενηςπερίθαλψης εντάσσεται στη συνολική κατεύθυνση για το λεγόμενο «Νέο ΕΣΥ», μεσυγχωνεύσεις- κλεισίματα νοσοκομείων, ιδιωτικοποιήσεις και ΣΔΙΤ (Tracking and Private Sector). Η δωρεάν περίθαλψη ήταν και είναι ξένο σώμα,περιττό έξοδο για το κράτος από το οποίο προσπαθεί να απαλλαγεί, γι’ αυτό τονοσοκομείο της πόλης μας έχει φτάσει σε αυτή την οριακή κατάσταση.

Είναι επιτακτική ανάγκη να συγκροτήσουμε τις αντιστάσεις μας απέναντι στηνεπίθεση στο δικαίωμά μας στην περίθαλψη. Οι κυβερνώντες και οι κεφαλαιοκράτεςέχουν κρατημένη θέση σε μία πολυτελή ιδιωτική κλινική για ό,τι και αν τουςσυμβεί, έχουν τον προσωπικό τους γιατρό (not sharing him with another 10,000), they have a drug store available to wait for them if they get sick. We, young people, workers, pensioners, the unemployed have nothing to do with all this. That is why we need to take to the streets and claim our right to equal, complete and free medical care.

** · Be now recruited medical and other staff **

** · Store all contractors **

** · Increases in wages covering the cost of living **

** · equal - complete - free care for all **

A few days after the "George W. Bush" aircraft carrier in Epiria, the spokesman for American imperialism, Foreign Minister A. Blinken will make visits to Greece and Turkey. ** US spokesman comes to upgrade American presence and potential, giving governments to governments, "sealing" American region, against competitors of imperialists, first and foremost. **

This is a challenge to a visit to the people!It is a forerunner of dangerous tools when the war in Ukraine is raging and intensifies an apprenticeship of Greek -Turkish competition.

** Especially now that a year of war is being completed in the heart of Europe. A war threatening the peoples of the world overall **, since the West Ukraine equipment is found by escalating the war on the part of the Eros and this escalation still follows. Larger equipment than tester. ** It is an upward spiral that is constantly prolonged by threatening megatization. ** While nuclear is the threat that makes the image of the past. The US -West conflict with Russia, albeit "indirectly" with the Tukranian Army vehicle, has caused a whole of the imperialist reinforcement. The Ukrainian people are paying a heavy blood tax because there has been a field of reaction between Americans and Russian imperialists for which it will "belong" geopolitical.

** Thousands of dead, millions of burst and a damaged country is a result for Ukraine. While the rest of the peoples immediately experienced the poverty of poverty and deficiencies in basic goods. **

It is also a challenge to exhaust our country's dependence on Ten -American imperialism, and its emergence, as a measure of upgrading the country. This is the line of the ND, SYRIZA, all urban parties, in total of the ruling class. They are once again betting that the Americans will give them points against the Turkish class. They have drafted "defensive" agreements and reactionary alliances of Meysrael and Egypt, reinforced the old bases and sowed new ones throughout the existence, buying equipment with money, sending weapons in Pukraine, claiming that we are in war with Russia. They turn all Tichora into an American bridge and tie the people into war risks!They even plan the mission of Greece's military personnel, in Pukraine.

** The result of the imperialist conflict in our region is the Acid Greek -Turkish. This reactionary confrontation loads peoples of the two countries with additional dangers. While at the same time poisoning peoples with hatred and nationalist delusions.

** The anti -war anti -imperialist struggle will strengthen!Only the struggle of the peoples can clog the road to the imperialists. **

** We call on the people to go on the way to the anti -war demonstrations that are nationwide. To stand up to his stature and defend his life and future. **

*** COUNTRY COUNTRY STOP TO WAR!** ** ** OUTSIDE - NATO - BASES!** ** PEOPLE DON'T NEED FROM PROTECTORS!!***** NO IN WAR!NO IN IMPERIALISM!** ** Solidarity - Peace - FRIENDS OF PEOPLE!**

# The Board of the Industrial Federation deceived the workers

![](Images/PUNALIPPU/2023-02-06T99-00-00-04-00/riku.jpg)Sunday 5.2. The government of the Federation of Finnish Industries approved the collective agreement for the technology industry and the chemical industry. The salary solution is as follows: The salaries of technology workers will increase by 3.5 % in 2023, which will be paid a lump sum of EUR 400, and 2.5 % in 2024, of which 0.5 % will be distributed locally. In the chemical industry, the corresponding figures are 2.2 %and 800 euros this year and next year 3.5 %, of which 0.2 %will be distributed locally.

The union, together with other SAK unions, was announcing the German IG Metal agreement comparable to the salary increase in Finland, and similarly, Jarkko Eloranta, chairman of the SAK, said last year that 3.5 % is not sufficient target level. In the IG Metallic Agreement, wages will increase by 8.5 %, of which 5.2 %this year and 3.3 %next year, in addition to which the state's subsidy, tax -free $ 1500, will be paid in each year. Thus, as far as the percentage, there were about 2.5 % units and a whopping 2600 euros for the lump sum. The government of the Finnish Industrial Federation thus retreated from its goals.

The leaders of the Industrial Federation claimed in the author's magazine published by the Association(n:ro11/2022)defend the workers. For example, the Officer of the Industrial Association's Chemistry Sector, "Our goal is to negotiate our members' purchasing power solution and to build a buffer for their inflation under a new collective agreement." Was "buffer"? Last year, inflation was about 8 % and this year has been predicted for 4-5 % inflation. Salary increases are clearly behind. In this respect, too, the union's government is giving up its goals.

The union's Kentiväki had explicitly demanded that the Federation of Finnish Industries to board without flexibility when the union council gathered in late November to wage negotiations in late November. Author(Hmm: Roro 12/2022)Report the following speeches from the council members: "The group follows Jervert German increases. At least it must come." - "It is a part of the Duunar's turn. - "Now on the field is full. - "We have to fight livelihoods for the entire contract system."

The departments have also demanded that the union's government not retreat. For example, the chairman of Metalli 5 has repeatedly demanded wage increases, which are at least as high as inflation, and the editorial of the magazine in that professor has criticized bourgeois propaganda, according to which low and middle-income people should accept the decline.

Thus, the government of the Federation of Finnish Industries also failed to play. This year, the Federation Council approved one of its priorities for the development of organizational strength, which is one point to develop members' inclusion. Is this how it is being built to deceive that membership? In the past decades, such decisions have even been subjected to a member's vote, even for vision.

Finally, since the technology industry, in particular, is considered to set a general line of wage increases in other sectors - and especially because the salary increases in public and nurses are in the contract with the tied technology industry, the chemical industry and(still open)The wage increases of the transport industry - the government of the Finnish Industry Association have generally failed to deceive the Finnish working class.  It is downright graceful to read in the Wordsman of the Finnish Industry Association's Labor Market Manager(Hmm: Roro 11/2022): "Every employee must be ready to defend their own working conditions". The workers were, but Hakaniemi's gentlemen were. Even the money would have been to pay for strike grants, as according to the union estimate, the union will be 7.5 million in this year.

Board of the Federation of Finnish Industries, chaired by Social Democratic College Riku Aalto and 1st Vice -Chairman, Left Alliance College Turja Lehtonen, the workers almost unanimously deceived.

Why did the government of the Finnish Industry Federation deceive the workers? Lenin has explained: ** "Opportunism is the sacrifice of the basic benefits of large -scale troops due to the temporary interests of the non -laborious minority [workers 'liabilities], to say the elite of the workers' part of the bourgeoisie for the bourgeoisie."More yellow trade unions can't even, because - Turja Lehtosenan words - "we are primarily a negotiating organization, but if necessary, we are ready to defend our members' interests very much." The strike on its own weapon, but for opportunistic federal bosses, it is hollow, and therefore apply bourgeois procedurally to negotiate, and, of course, workers experience the loss time and time again.

Lenin has advised: ** "transition to a revolutionary organization is free, it requires a changed historical situation, the season of the revolutionary activities of the demanding traletariat, - but the transition is only possible by ignoring the old leaders, revolutionary supporters, by crossing the old party, crushing."

This, the path of a revolutionary class struggle, is also the only way to achieve wage increases or other reforms, because, as Lenin is an onset, ** "Either revolutionary struggle, which, as a by -product of which, does not complete the Reforms ... or just speech reforms and no other".

The Finnish Federation of Finnish Industries has failed the widespread troops of the Finnish workers, but the high -rise, high -rise, high -rise, high -speed inflation and rising interest rates, with its high interest rates, ensures that the contradiction proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to exacerbate the struggle.

![LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund1](Images/COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL/2023-02-06T99-00-00-04-00/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_1.png)This message was not only powerfully spread, but also joyfully accepted bymany masses. Several times masses asked for the flags of the ICL, which werecarried on the demonstration in four languages - Spanish, English, Turkish andGerman. Some even wanted to buy them on the spot. An excerpt of the ICL'sPolitical Declaration and Principles was distributed as a leaflet, andPartizan comrades handed out printed brochures with the Declaration in Englishand Turkish. Thus, the radiance that the LLL demonstration has in the FRG andparts of Western Europe was used to celebrate and spread this success of theMaoists.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-16-58-00-00/2023020_Reused-Kurot-Poverty-929x1024.png)The people do not feel, especially the poor, the proud Noferdinand Marcos Jr.(GDP or local production)of the Philippines. According to the Kadamay group, the "Far Sasikura" of the Poor Filipino is the "Development" of Marcosjr's "Development". They do not expect the "President President" to meet their abdominal stomach.

The poor mocked Marcos Jr's reign as the "hungry era." According to State Statistics, grew up to 20 million(increased by 2.3million)The poor in 2022. Most of the hunger suffered between October and December last year due to the rising prices.

“Flash in the Pan” or something that just passed quickly and the Bird Foundation's call to the GDP's proud growth. "Rebound" is just a matter of the intense economic collapse caused by the tight lockdown during the pandemya. It will surely have a steep drop this year, according to the institution.

The government is just cheating on the public in connection with growth, according to the bird. It only wants to put up the "Great Timing" of Marcos Jr to the economy. In fact, it will not last long because the "growth" has been resolved from the historical 9.5% of the local production collapse in 2020. “It will return(economy)in the former pattern of slow growth before the fate. ”

In fact, the slowdown in the fourth room of 2022 has begun where the economy has changed 7.2%, slower in the entire 2022. The "revenge spending" or increased spending of families(household consumption)has been in the second bedroom of the year. There was no expenditure even during the holiday season.

Meanwhile, agricultural production has fallen for the third year. According to state data, local agricultural growth in 2022. Prior to that, production in the sector by -1.7%(2021)at -1.2%(2020). Kahit noong 2019, di signipikante ang paglago ngagrikultura (0.3%). Sa magkasunod na tatlong taon, bagsak ang pananim atpangisda. Bahagyang tumaas ang produksyon ng livestock (1.9%)But it is not impaired to increase the development of the entire sector.

#### Not a solution to the crisis

The Philippine economic economic crisis will not be resolved by the Philippine Development Plan(PDP)2023-2028, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s economic program The bird called the plan to "obsolete" its outline.

This PDP, according to the institution, has been ninth to the "development programs" from the time of the Marcos dictatorship. From then to the present, these programs have focused on implementing reforms in "free trade." This simply means that export-to-export production will continue as the reactionary reactionary to attract foreign investment.

The bird presented state data stating that the portion of export production grew from 16% of the GDP in the 1980s to 40% in 2000.(5% of GDP)to 29% currently.

In front of it, the manufacturing and agricultural manufacture of the manufacturing and agriculture from 1950. Also, the number of employees' employment will diminish.

PDP 2022-2028 will further devour the country into a severe crisis. This is because the plan of globalization policy is structured by extensive employment, poverty and lack of development in the past four.

Instead of developing, the regime will continue to kill the productive economy, in particular agriculture, through no importance. It will not provide support even for current production.

Similar to the economic plans of the previous reactionary regimes, it has no intention of giving workers a living wage and program for land reform, increasing prices for agricultural purchase of farmers and other reforms to lift the life and livelihood of the majority of Filipinos.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-19-01-00-00/20230207_editorial-cartoon-1024x724.png)It is clear to the Filipino people Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the current chief of the puppet state, is no different from his father-in-law: both puppet, fascist, corrupt and torture, and indifferent to the hunger and suffering of .

These reasons bind and pushed the people to revolt for more than three and a half decades later. It also binds them today to fight to advance and defend their own rights and well -being, and their desire for true proverbial and democracy. Like the father dictator, Marcos Jr. uses the decaying and most distorted ways of the ruling class in the construction of the crisis of the semicolonial and semifeudal system in the Philippines.

Marcos Jr. is submissive in foreign powers and has no luxury in the country's surrender and welfare of the country's independence and welfare to the power of power, especially the US and China.

Neoliberal policies started by his father in the 1970s, Marcos Jr. He pushes the todo-largangliberalization into investment and importation on behalf of the "full open door." It is given all favors and promises to foreign capitalists, especially low wages to workers and non -taxation. Foreign capitalists are also given the most freedom of the land of the farmers and minority citizens, and the wealth of the mountains, rivers and oceans.

For decades these policies have destroyed the livelihood of the people, the local production and economy of the Philippines. On behalf of liberalization of importation, foreign goods in the country are allowed to pile up and the local production, especially in agriculture. The peasant masses are no longer able to breathe because of the amount of imported rice, variety, onions, garlic, and even salt. On behalf of deregulation, bourgeois compradors are released big compradors, and importer Atismagler(which is usually the same people or family only)To make the price of commodities too much.

In the past four decades, the production of the Philippines has continued to decline and further deteriorate and the country's economy is increasing. Foreign investment in "export processing zones" is "developing" even though it does not develop the local economy. To fill the fading money due to uneven foreign trade, the country will further depend on foreign debt and sending Filipino workers overseas the country's dollar. Every year, up to a quarter of the country's budget the country will It goes to repayment, which is not benefited by the people.

Like the crooked priority of his father and the following governmental government, Marcos JR's health, education and other social services are lacking. On the other hand, the funds that have been derived from the Armed Forces of ThePhilippines have grown in size(AFP)To buy helicopters and warships, as well as bombs, ammunition and other warships that will be used to use, intimidate and break the resistance of the people.

Marcos Jr.'s declaration of "everyone's friend" is a policy of slavery to everyone. In concrete, he recently agreed with the US government and military plan to set up five more military bases in AFP military camps in Cagayan, Isabela and Palawan. It is planned to use them to station troops and to place the shooting to focus on China. Marcos also agreed that US warships and NGAFP warships and forces were supposed to have a joint patrol. These measures are part of the US military strategy used by the Philippines, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and other countries, which are available for use in the China war, as it has used in Ukraine for guarantee Russia.

Meanwhile, Marcos seems to be doing nothing in the face of China's continued use of seven military facilities that have built many of the Philippine maritime territory. In fact, Marcos invited the China Construction and Communication Corporation, a China government-governmental company that is famous for bribery and corruption. This is among the companies of the Philippines in the massive damage to the Philippine ocean. Marcos has invited the operation of this company to the Philippines, in exchange for an additional loan from China.As Marcos Jr. grew stronger, the corruption and harm of the people intensified, the brutality of the reactionary state against the people intensified and intensified. With the US among imperialist, the AFP and Philippinenational Police campaign will be underway(PNP)In suppressing the people. Military Law was attacked by Marcos's political repression and anti-insurgency today. It is not uncommon to hurt human rights and international laws.

As under Marcos Sr, the masses, peasants, peasants and entire people under Marcos JR, were in the masses and hardships, while the landlords, large comprador and foreign capitalists, were swimming in luxury and luxury. In the face of their oppression and exploitation, it is clear that there is no other path for the people but the revolutionary resistance.
