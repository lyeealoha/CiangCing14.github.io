<p><strong>Palestine, February 6, 2023:</strong> Veteran Palestinian activist Leila Khaledsaid on Sunday that Washington "has become Zionist and has been working toabort Palestinian resistance against Israeli occupation."</p>
<p>The member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine (PFLP) told <em>Al-Resalah</em> that, "Betting on the Biden administrationwill not give us more than extra losses." Thirty years of peace talks under USpatronage has been a waste of time, she added. "Washington does not haveallies, it only has people and states which serve its interests."</p>
<p>Khaled made her comments after a meeting between Palestinian Authority leaderMahmoud Abbas and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ramallah, and thedisclosure of an American plan proposed to Abbas that aimed to "abort"Palestinian resistance.</p>
<p>"The US administration will not stop illegal Israeli settlements, will notcancel its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the state, will not stopmaintaining Israel's arms superiority in the region and will not stop itsunlimited support for Israel."</p>
<p>The PFLP official reiterated the importance of resuming the internalPalestinian reconciliation process based on the outcomes of the comprehensivenational dialogue led by the secretaries-general of the Palestinian factions,reactivating legitimate resistance and supporting Palestinians everywhere.However, concluded Khaled, Palestinian unity cannot be achieved without a"clear comprehension" of partnership based on democratic rules.</p>
