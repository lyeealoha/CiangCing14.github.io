<p><strong>  -- Central Committee,  Proletarian Party of Purbo Bangla (Purbo Banglar Shorbohara Party -PBSP/Bangladesh)  (March, 2021)</strong>  (Republished in revised and extended form by CC, June 2021)</p>
<p>Proletarian Party of Purbo Bangla (Purbo Banglar Shorbohara Party - PBSP) wasfounded 50  years ago, on June 3rd, 1971, with the leadership of the then leader and thefounder of the  party, Comrade Siraj Sikder (SS). That was the period of Liberation War ofEast Bengal  against the national oppressor state of Pakistan. The then main bourgeoisparty Awami League  fled to india, leaving people helpless under the genocide of Pakistanigenocide. Before that, at  the eve of genocide, their main leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman surrendered tothe Pakistanis.  Other leaders, exploiting the movement, struggle, sacrifice abd self-dedication of the people,  sold the country to India, for their own self-interest of power, while fleeingthere.  At that time, Maoists, as a newly risen force, despite their various politicaland  sujective weaknesses, stuck out for the people in danger. Contrary to fakeIndian-Awami  liberation war, they waged an actual/revolutionary war of liberation invarious parts of the  country. Siraj Sikder, the founder of our party, in a situation of absence ofpower, organizing a  revolutionary army at Peyarabagan area in Barishal, created a short-livedliberated area. There  he founded the "Proletarian Party" on June 3. Earlier during Pakistani rule,he founded "East  Bengal Workers' Movement" as a preparatory organisation for founding a partyof its kind. He  transformed it into the Shorbohara Party, a proletarian party, in the middleof the sound of  shelling of cannon in 1971.  As we are celebrating 50th anniversary of founding of the party today, we must</p>
<p>remember the consistent heroic struggles under the leadership of the party andthe sacrifice  and self-dedication of numerous leaders, ranks and people, with the leadershipof the party,  during this half a century. We must remember the contributions, teachings,sacrifices and  heroic martyrdom of Comrade SS, the founder of the party. The guiding light ofthese, were  the revolutionary ideological-political and theoretical positions of ourparty. On the other hand,  we must be tremendously conscious about various mistakes and historicallimitations of party's  ideological-political-military line and struggle during the time of it'sfoundation and various  stages later on. In order to become conscious about the positive bases andnegative aspects of  the party, and to continue the Maoist revolutionary struggle in this country,Com. Anowar  Kabir, party leader after SS, had led the party for almost four decades. Herelentlessly  summarized vast experiences of the party, in that process, overcame newlycommited mistakes  also, and step by step, equipped the party with the correctness of Maoistline. The developed  form of which has been primarily contained in the "New Thesis" approved in2011, and in the  report of the Fourth Congress in 2017. In a new perspective of internationalcommunist  movement, these presented a qualitatively higher direction in nationalcommunist movement.  Which paved the way of development of lines and struggles of later period, andestablished  their new foundation.  This direction is teaching us that, we could not see the foundation andstruggle of our  party in the perspective of overall Maoist movement during '70s, and for along time later on  as it's continuity. That is why, Maoist unity could not have been built.During those times,  beside our party, some other Maoist centers worked in this country at thattime. The main parts  of those had revolutionary contributions in the liberation war of 1971 aswell. We must asses  overall Maoist movement including them as well. However Maoist movement beganeven  before that time, including the preparatory measures for founding our party.Although bigparts of the Maoist forces of the movement of that time, laterwere in down-fall due to various  national-international jeopardy, at various periods, including a part of ourparty also.  It is very important to grasp, how in this long adverse period, our partystruggled  against various revisionist and deviationist lines in national andinternational sphere, and how  it corrected it's own mistakes and developed our party line. Because withoutthis, ultimately it  wouldn't be possible to comprehend any revolutionary line or struggle today.Neither is it  possible to give real meaning to the celebration of the anniversary of thefoundation of the  party or Maoist people's war.  In these struggles, there were various aspects of ideological-political-military line and  various complex paths of international line. Where, with the leadership ofComrade Anowar  Kabir, our party played a leading role and made itself actually an almost soleMaoist  revolutionary center in this country. Despite there are still some Maoistcenters and dedicated  Maoists outside our party, but it is beyond doubt that this party of ours isestablished in the  country as a self-assesment oriented, dynamic, creative and revolutionaryMaoist party. The  bases of this, are the teachings of Comrades SS and AK, which have beensynthesized in our  `New Thesis', Report of the 4th Congress and in other documents.  * Similarly, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Maoist People's War also. In  reality, our party initiated Maoist people's war in 1970, as well as someother centers. But in  special situations of 1971, maoist people's war greatly appeared as a distinctand special entity  in the political spheres of this country. As it's continuity, in the firsthalf of '70s, people's war  turned into a heroic tumultuous struggle around the country, with theleadership of some  Maoist centers; our party was the foremost among them.  But everybody knows, that upsurge couldn't last long. The reason for it was,on one  hand, brutal suppression by anti-revolutionary enemies of the people, on theother hand,  mistakes of the Maoists themselves (including our party), some of which werevery serious.  Similarly, the later risings of ours and others', specially the struggle ofMadaripur in 80s and  country-wide 2nd armed upsurge a bit later in our party's leadership, hadbecome destroyed.  In addition, there is the serious crises in world revolutionary struggle dueto the disasters in  worldwide Maoist movement, during the last one and a half decade.  In oder to overcome these, our party is working with all the dedicatedrevolutionary and  revolution-aspirant forces over the world for a long time. RIM was founded asthe new center  of Maoists worldwide, and with its impact and leadership, a new revolutionarywave was  being created around the world. But, despite it's significant contributions inreconstruction and  development of world communist movement for two decades, RIM became inactivefor  various reasons, from the end of the first decade of this century. Theimportant reasons among  them are: (1) the appearance of a rightist anti-people's war line in Peru,where a big part of  central leadership of Peru were involved, in some way or another; (2)abandonment of  people's war and betrayal of revolution by Prachanda-revisionism in Nepal; and(3) deviation  from proletarian class outlook, the essence of MLM, by Avakian Leadership with"New  Communism," in America. Besides these, lack of consciousness about thenecessity of forming  RIM, namely an International Center for revolutionary communists, by someimportant Maoist  forces of the world also weakened our international unity and strength.  But dedicated Maoist revolutionaries worldwide, including our party, are re-evaluating  the problems, and trying to create anew an international center/agreement. Ourparty is also  contributing to this initiative.  * Meanwhile, international and national socio-economic and political situations have  changed vastly, which is exerting huge impacts on the strategy &amp; tactics ofpeople's war.  Specially, in most countries like ours, socio-economic situation immenselychanged. Although</p>
<p>3  agriculture basically remained semi-feudal, centering which the huge changesmust be  comprehended.  Due to the above-mentioned things, vast development of communication system,  mobile, IT, military technology, technology in general, and the tremendousstrengthening of  centralised state machinery, has presented the military questions in verydifferent ways than  before; the solution of which is not yet complete. Only through consistent andcumbersome  practice of peoples war in various countries can these problems be overcome.Principle and  strategies of war and struggle must be developed. Carbon copies of previousstruggles would  not work. Although the only way this is possible, is by making country sidesthe base, making  peasants the major force, sticking to the principle of protracted people's war-- not in any  other way.  We must be conscious about the changes in the national and internationalsituation.  Since there is no socialist country any more in the world, there are threebasic contradictions  active worldwide. Among them, the contradiction between imperialism andoppressed nations  and people is the principal one. Inter-imperialist contradiction is showinghints of a bi-polar  world once again. On one hand, there is US-led imperialists and their allies,and on the other,  Chinese social imperialism, Russian imperialism, the the forces led by them.It is exavatating  the crisis in them. As a result, people's struggle against imperialism andtheir various policies  and their war mongerings is rising up in various countries of the world.Imperialists and their  agents are resorting to fascism to avoid the crises. They are immenselyexpanding their  preparations for war. All of these are emphasising the significance of guidingpeople's struggle  according to correct ideology, programs and path. Subjective ability of ourMLM forces are  trailing behind the objective revolutionary situations. We must increase ourefforts manifolds  in order to reduce the difference by developing revolutionary party, struggle,and people's war.  * Our tasks must be clear on the occassion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of  the party and of people's war. Which are: (1) Forming a single Maoist party ofa new type by  uniting all the dedicated Maoists; (2) building a successful people's war withthe leadership of  this party; (3) organising and uniting huge number of people in various vividorganisations and  fronts; and (4) creating a new 'International' of maoists worldwide. The basisof these tasks  would be a qualitatively higher ideological-political line, and military andinternational line.  Regarding these important tasks, we, all the leaders, ranks, supporters andpeople must  move forward towards greater struggle. And must keep working for materializingthe dream of  all revolutionaries. They must continue doing so until the end, until the lastbreathe. They must  be always prepared for self-dedication, for sacrifice of any kind, for servingthe people. And  for that, they must grasp Marxism-Leninism-Maoism more deeply. They mustentirely  dedicate themselves to the struggle for the liberation of the proletariat andoppressed people all  over the world.</p>
