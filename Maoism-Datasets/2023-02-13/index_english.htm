The war was relevant to the World Capital World Market with design of imperialist federations and the advantage of the multitude of countries to try to position themselves in order to avoid a plot. The war may have a long-term cyclic phase, finding the seismic of the general destruction, "allowed" destruction, negotiations, occasional preparations and new alliances. Wide mass suffers are already being statistically registered only in the propaganda purposes of imperialists.</p>
<p>In the previous imperialist wars, the Balkans was one of the hubs that played a significant role in the general conflicts. This historical sequence can be intended for him. The initial symptoms of such flow of events are already being clearly.</p>
<p>Due to the growth of its power, the ambition of the Turkish regime was taken on by Megalomaniac. Understanding Turkey's importance in the fight between Western and Russian-temperaillism, its current regime can also be used to greater influence on Nabalkan. Turkey has already partially achieves its conquerable goals in Syria, constantly justifying its position to combat Kurdish movements, as well as the average Asia. Due to the comparability of Russia, she is currently not turned against himself, Turkey is constantly blackmailing NATO, seeking a variety of Kurdish movements, and above all the threat to Ipute resources in the Mediterranean, which would lead the NATO Pact.</p>
<p>In the coming months, the period of great challenges in the coming months are because they will cut all forces outside, and and from the inside, to attach to the Turkish to its sidered the realization of the pipes in the Global War.Permanent, open and concealed idea of the Serbian bourgeoisie about the so-called The Serbian worldwide faces the ultimate choice between open collaboration and occupation of debris imperialism or the Gubernian covenant to Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>The current war shows how much is the small sovereignty of the largest European countries, while its existence is questionable when it comes to the Balkan countries. They are, moreover, just a service in this conflict of interimperistalist federations in almost central debt bondage, which is converted to NATobase, Bulgaria that is currently being stronger to maintain not to succumb to the unpaired appetites of all Neighbors, Albania, which in the more powerful namesPriche and binding sees the possibility of strengthening the Albanian people in one state in the ethnic principle, is a levy of the self-grinding of the Montenegrin nation, the rush of aggressive Greater Serbia, BiH, which is After the explosion of interconionals and social commissions, the masses found in a state of complete passivity, incapable of determining its future, Croatia in which all major discolutions in its participation in the interprehensor in its fair struggle for Sam The rest has not yet been fully employed by their formal statehood and is in the status of a semicotor.</p>
<p>The global war of the imperialist receives all the wider and deeper character and the Balkans cannot be able to preserve peace. To preserve peace in an effort to unilaterally a multi-sided role, they could continue to rob the people, unfairing the landing of the country and abducting its natural resources.</p>
<p>Accelerated militarization of the Balkan states and increasing accumulation of NATO forces, penetrations of intelligence and paramilitaneous emperiologist's emphasis approach the approximate opening of the so-called Balkan Front. The opening of that front is directly from the relationship between interprehistralist forces at the moment in the currently elevent front and how the situation will develop there.</p>
<p>What is the state of Balkan folk mass?Also, the Balkan masses currently have no confidence in their strength to demolish the regimes, nor can they resist war politics and the war, especially that the Balkan masses in the classification of the class enemy, diseasing and without a strong revolutionary entity. This revolutionary resolution is too weak, and Balkan masses do not even have any strong unions of Nifrontovska organizations that would more active to combat capitalists, multinational companies and economic policies. However, this compounds can change from the basis in a very short time and while the disbelief shows their class strength.</p>
<p>What is the task of a revolutionary entity, regardless of their current strength, in those future war conflicts?</p>
<p>First of all, to encourage Balkan masses not to participate in the interprehensisticalsuke, not to be cannoneal meat for the interests of imperialists and their respective authorities.</p>
<p>It is uncertain on whose side will be regimes in the interprematial war on the Nabal Croatian front, but it does not matter to access one revolutionary system in these conflicts.</p>
<p>The division into Prorus and Fontifications will be the main political cost of the and the main source of reactionary conflicts in most Balkan countries, as it is its creation and national bourgeoisicom, and in the masses themselves. Ita division will go beyond the decading indigenation of interethnic hatred.</p>
<p>Balkan masses are located in position - or that they currently agree to the sloppiness of the imperialists and their crowd regimes, or to seek out the accessory in revolutionary forms of resistance. Especially when Ratnamshinery takes on the grooving forms by them.</p>
<p>The process is painful but historically inevitable.</p>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> There is a critical shortage of personnel, especially nurses and doctors, in the Norwegian health care system. Government officials warn that the future means even more patients per employee. </strong></p>
<p>As of February 2022, about half of Norwegian municipalities reported "challenging or critical access to personnel and critical competence". In particular, doctors and nurses municipalities notified a lack of. This was expressed in the lack of capacity for GPs, emergency rooms, home services, institutions, vaccination, testing and infection tracking. This situation was an exception that was only due to the pandemic handling that was then in full swing. The nurses' trade union now states that this is the current situation: «Nursing shortages and other personnel shortages are everywhere, in the municipalities and nursing hospitals. It's a crisis. "</p>
<p>The Health Personnel Commission was reduced by the government to assess the situation with a lack of personnel in the health care system. According to the Trade Union, which organizes hundreds of thousands of public employees, the Commission recommends _ not_at overall health and care personnel should increase significantly beyond the current level. Instead, they suggest that more employees work full time. The Commission proposes that "more efforts must be made on prevention and that <strong> people take care of their own health </strong> to reduce the pressure on health services"(Our highlight).</p>
<p>Kommisjonslederen har slått fast overfor NRK at det blir færre ansatte perpasient. Den demografiske utviklingen ligger til grunn: Det blir flere eldre,samtidig som det fødes færre barn. Utvalgsleder Gunnar Bovim sier: «Dethjelper ikke med en milliard her og en milliard der. Det blir færre ansatteper pasient. Den erkjennelsen må vi ta med oss på alle nivå.»</p>
<p>Dermed står norsk helsevesen i den situasjonen at man på den ene siden har en_personellmangelkrise_ : Det er for få ansatte, for få arbeidstimer, oghalvparten av kommunene klarer ikke å gi den helsetjenesten folk har krav på.På den andre sida vil det bli <em>færre</em> , ikke flere, ansatte i forhold tilpasienter i årene som kommer!For å gjøre situasjonen enda verre varslerhelseministeren innstramminger på grunn av dyrtida.</p>

<p>So the Berliner Morgenpost titles the election election on the last Sunday in Berlin, speaks of "dramatic numbers". The Berliners are "frustrated and at least motivated" in relation to the new election theater.</p>
<p>"It is actually a very good election weather - we have neither ice nor snow -hole rain. And you can make the election wonderfully with a Sunday walk," hoped the ruling master mayor Franziska Giffey from the SPDNoch on the day of the election.</p>
<p>Obviously, the burger journal, also no longer passing the Volkliche democracy and the tendency to re -expenses of the choice farce. This becomes particularly clear when you make the following verbal statistics in mind:</p>
<p>"Party end result measured in urban levels CDU 12 percent SPD 8 percent Grune 8 percent left 5 percent FDP 2 percent AfD 4 percent"</p>
<p>But the official figures also look very constructive for the parliamentary of Crete. In Mitte, Spandau, Neukolln, Marzahn-Hellersdorf and Lichtenberg, the turnout was sometimes significantly below 60 percent. In Treptow-Kopenick even only minimally over 50 percent.</p>
<p>Overall, the turnout was "lower than fuses", said the Berlin newspaper, around 63 percent. If it was still 75.4 percent in 2021, an "extremely low voter turnout" and "an election debacle of the special kind" appeared to be subsequently. The numbers seem even more drasty when Mansich takes in mind that until the 1990s, Inberlin voter turnout was 80 percent and it.</p>

<p>The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Switzerland(Red Faction)adheres to the joint international statement, "Let's Develop the RevolutionaryStruggle Against the Imperialist War Preparations!", and wishes to be added tothe list of signatories, with the following reservation that it wishes to havepublished as a note to the statement:    "It is the position of the Communist Party of Switzerland(Red Faction)thatthe principal contradiction in Ukraine today is between Russian imperialismand the Ukrainian nation, although the inter-imperialist contradiction playsan important secondary role. The Russo-Ukrainian War should therefore not beunderstood principally as a proxy war between two imperialist superpowers, butas Ukraine's war of national liberation against the Russian war of aggression.The Kyiv regime currently wages this war of national liberation due to itrepresenting the pro-Western faction of the Ukrainian big bourgeoisie, whilethe pro-Russian faction supports capitulation to Russia, and Kyiv should besupported on this basis. This is in no way different from the support given tothe Nationalist regime in China by Comrade Mao Zedong during the War ofResistance Against Japan, when the pro-Japanese faction of the Chinese bigbourgeoisie, as represented by Wang Jingwei, capitulated to Japan, and thepro-Western faction, as represented by Jiang Jieshi, resisted Japan to acertain point. Mao pointed out:    "The Chinese big bourgeoisie, which is comprador in character, is a classwhich directly serves imperialism and is fostered by it. Hence the compradorChinese big bourgeoisie has always been a target of the revolution. However,different groups within this big bourgeoisie are backed by differentimperialist powers, so that when contradictions among these powers becomesharper and when the edge of the revolution is mainly directed against aparticular power, the big bourgeois groups dependent upon the other powers mayjoin the struggle against that particular imperialist power to a certainextent and for a certain time.

<p>Comrades, competitors and colleagues filled the room early as. Dinos was particularly beloved in our city both socially and for his struggling and consistent racing action in all the kinematic events of the region and the wider area. The following event was spoken by S. Litsa Sapounas on behalf of the Trikala organization of the KKE.(ML), S. Stefanoskapnias on behalf of the KKE KKE(ML), his brother Sakis Papadopoulos, Giannis Ritsios, Sylvi Tsala from the modern Communist and his colleague Christoforos Sargiotis.</p>
<p>_ Following the placement of the Trikala Organization of the KKE(ML)_</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-12T99-00-00-04-00/ekdilwsi-dinos-papadopoulos-2.jpg" />On behalf of the Trikala party organization of the KKE(ML)I welcome you to this event we organized for partner Dino.</p>
<p>One year has passed since we lost our partner and yet our sadness is great. His personality and action left them both to us, his comrades and the movement.</p>
<p>What distinguished him was his ideological and political composition, hesis of words and actions, the purity of his thinking, characteristics that have resulted in his integration into the movement through the lines of the PPSSPA and the KKE.(ML)then for nearly 50 years. He was still a member of the KKE's leadership body(ML)for many years.</p>
<p>His entrance to the university brought him close to revolutionary ideas. For his involvement in the uprising of the Technical University, few companions of the most elaborate we knew. He didn't dwell. Perhaps because they were abhorred by the redemption of some people in systemic poses. Perhaps because he considered his participation in this folk and youth revolt.The collapses of the regimes of the eastern bloc and in the inner ears have led to the demobilization of the movement and a large number of priests. It was the time when systemic factors were talking about the triumph of capitalism, about the end of history, and the reformists of all kinds were officially officially under the wings of the system.</p>
<p>Our partner stood up and through the lines of the organization gave us battles for the need to continue the construction of a communist movement, through participation in the class struggle and he was putting in, supporting the competitors of other currents. Then he was actively struggling on the fighting left.</p>
<p>It was leading the creation of wide movements in our city that favor the action of action and enable more massive mobilizations. "We are walking together, we hit together," he often said. The most striking cases are the creation of the "<strong> anti-imperialist movement </strong>" during the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the second Iraq. Also the creation of the "<strong> Initiative of Workers - Undersecretary of Common Action </strong>" during the Memorandums in the direction of developing resistance to the rolling of the workers' and popular conquests.</p>
<p>Also important was his contribution to the agricultural claims to both the development of positions and to the shaping line.</p>
<p>The attitude he kept all the years of his life was not with where he went mood but with the law of labor and popular interests. He was deeply convinced that the capitalist-imperialist system would unfold all of its ruling, lead humanity to barbarism, try to take the historical rematch and cancel the conquests and rights that the working class had been guaranteed. Of course, the decisive effect of these communist movement.</p>
<p>Especially today that the contradictions of imperialists have been acute and driven by a new conflict, which crumbles all overnight conquests.(As the slogan says), which accurately exterminates the meagernesses and expanded popular strata are led to poverty and renewing.To fight for the creation of resistance and claim front. For the consolidation of the Communist movement as a prerequisite for the Salary and Labor struggles that erupt not invested in "saviors" pillars of the system but in the case of overthrowing adverse correlations and in building a society without exploitation, without wars, no evasion.</p>
<p>We honor Comrade Dino for his contribution to our organization, for his access to the popular movement. We are proud to have had such a caringist in our lines.</p>

<p>_</p>
<p>From the intervention of Comrade Slai Cobas SC_The discussion that we have done several times with the workers on the war that part is intertwined with daily life must now be seen as a different unlike because the immediate enemy on this is different, it is ilgoverno. You do not directly face the individual master who would also individually be against the war but the problem is instead ilgoverno, which represents the interests of the capitalist masters as a class in the background ... it is necessary that the workers, the workers who are committed to the fight in the fight, or who still do not struggle shift attention from one's ownimmediato who is completely intertwined with the general life to put attention on what is not easily seen, where thisguer comes from, because the imperialist war ... _</p>
<p>_Gli objectives of the struggle and in the fight are two mainly: _</p>
<p>_The first, the government is the main enemy of the workers, workers, popular masses, today the reactionary government Meloni/Crosetto in a Neapheis/Servism to the USA/born in order not to be marginalized in Europe, Nonsolo is continuing but is strengthening the policies of war, expenditure, war propaganda, see schools ... if we do not clearly tell workers, workers, women who really oppose the war against the government of your home, you are not giving a right message, leave the workers in indifference or in ignorance or deceiving them/deviating the goal, the scope of the struggle to be made; Others/objective are the workers themselves, hence the attempt to make a Farequesto Committee, we have already started spreading the flyer/appeal, we have made a collection of signatures with the worker motion promoted by the Slaima open to all the realities that share it in Some workplaces of schools where precarious coops have been activated to the factory, at the construction site, naval among the workers to involve other workers ... _</p>
<p>_Ra, there have been initiatives in this year of reality, of militants who made complaints, actions against war, see in Palermo the Noguerra Assembly of which there are some representatives here today, an assembly where we participated where we considered it right to do so , but the heart of the problem are the workers with the heart of the heart of the workers, of the hesitative place/nodal center of the exploitation of the capital/work wages where there is still no necessary mobilization ... __A a year later as workers in this country, but we can also widen to other countries, we have not managed despite all the nostrisforzi to stop this war ... last year a right signal and important was the event called by the workers of the GKN a Florence, the working and popular Primamanifestation against the war but this path did not have an effective class development to change strength relationships, today are important and right signals to be supported, to extend and to cuicollers like those who come from the ports of Genoa ... It is necessary to work also by small actions in a path that must lead us to GrandDializations ... small but determined steps ... _</p>
<p>_ The arrow of the current government is daily, military expenses increase, military plans and military shares increase on how to use for example bases, of which Italy is full, see the issue of nuclear weapons, 13,000 are nuclear weapons in World, today from Russia to NATO to Chinitutti, those who speak of tactical nuclear power, as if it were less destructive, Chenon would destroy entire cities, but this way of speaking/threatening war, human life is truly indicative of the level of barbariaidiological/political system of the system imperialist in crisis that uses wars to granted from the deep crisis ... of course we do not make the list of the wars of the course in the world that is pretended that there are no problem is that is one every now and then of wars that can really change The ScenarioDefinito, is this war of the clash between Russia and Ukraine which is the fans as they say in the game of the chess of the imperialist states given to all the alts ri that is in the middle of the massacre of populations, is a hindering those things that could lead to nuclear war, we do not say it noima they say they themselves in many official declarations or bourgeois darly articles, there is a continuous advancing towards a abyss that is that appropriate of the definitive nuclear war .__Information/counter -information/action/mobilization ... but at the base there must be clarity towards workers, proletarians, positions, basic nuns of the war ... because otherwise it seems that we are talking about a bad guys, and it is not enough to say yes this war make it For money, for profits, that is, we have a series of insights also to do and Perquesto we are also reserving that alongside the practical actions there is also the study/analysis with our proletarian vehicles but it is necessary to do it._</p>
<p><em>The 24 one year after the outbreak of this interimperialist war in all over the world will be made to report, struggle but also the alpower bourgeois will make them to convince the rightness of this barbarism, therefore 24 workers will serve as a basis to have our own from the point Diven in the proletarian class, in Rome on 18 we will be at the proletariaticapitalist assembly to connect with other workers who want to fight intral meaning .</em></p>
<p>_Nel Invitation flyer for today's assembly that we wrote: _</p>
<p>_ To the imperialist war, no to the active participation of the Governomeloni Nero in war, no to the increase in military expenditure, the government's digests compared only to Ukraine is around billionalesing of a few months with 10 decrees issued, while for the expenses Militariin General are 27.7 billion in a year until now and the government has Dettoche intends to bring them to 38 billion, six billion to healthcare have been in this financial financial one to give an example; No to the caravan that combuncies as the last point that for us workers, precarious workers, eproletal proletarians becomes a serious problem in daily life but on the question is not the first problem in a logical and then in a strategic sense, in general the increase in prices More or less in this system there is, today it is amplified by the war issue ... The presentation of the Committee is a first momentum, a first necessary proposal that providing in the next few days of working workers for a bracing of workers, workers, as a stimulus, as a stimulus, push that can be for others, from this point of view we start with the order of order "to stop the imperialist war" is a difficult operation but it must also be ... _Partner Slai cobas sc</p>
<p>_The bourgeoisie in power, now represented by its mostrely fraction with the Meloni government, uses all the means to make a campaignquotidiana at the mass level to convince that this war is right, conun Parliament asserted where there is no opposition, all the parliament from the component Fascist to the Democratic Party has continued to vote for the sending of weapons ... All Imezzi, one of these is for example the school, today there are workers who can make a contribution of what happens in schools, where the Ministry/usr sign protocols with the Army to force glistitants to make the school -work alternation in the field of barracks and now also of the bases, see Sigonella, students who must be "worked" in the school in service of the needs of capital to be exploited to be autoned and to go to war, like new children for the homeland of the Governomeloni who incites them in different forms to have children ... we start by starting around March 8th that a D one year of war must still see workers again at the forefront against the war, you must see us again against ... _</p>
<p>_Da one side the working class is deprived of an autonomous organization apolitical that really does the interests of the class, which lays, organicly, the organic confederal unions of the masters are those that like the Fiom at the Fincantieri of Palermo in the Fincantieri are doing War ships, and here there are precarious workers who have had ipads who worked in that factory, applauds the fact that the shopping ship has ended instead of calling a strike, the non -workers can fire, work "with Magone "As someone told us about the ship who were building aware of what it was used, but we do not in a phase like 68/69 where the working class was strong and iPadroni were afraid because we remember that some laws/reforms were made for fear that the bourgeoisie then had on the level of the dating ... but we must go to the workers, bring a different, clear message, a proposal for action of Pour ... we need to face how the masters make their fronts, this war is a thieving of it, we will bring the work that we set ourselves to do here to connect it with the actions/struggles of other workers, workers, precarious workers in Rome ... _From the intervention of an activist of the No Muos Palermo committee and Noguerra Assembly</p>
<p>_Condivid a large part of the discussion, I share concerns, they try to remove the future, those who make great profits on the war today are Laleonardo, the Fincantieri who in Palermo the other day has launched a Daguerra ship with the main pomp of the various political representatives, but while while They made money to attack the employees who decrease ... Leonardo also signed an agreement with the unions who fire 600 workers among the 45E 55 years of age therefore to the detriment of what the working class is the great money ... the government as The Slai companions said, he takes away his content, to the school, to social expenses ... a war that does not start at random, it is a war that accompanied us already in previous years, already from the Fatodella Second World War when the Americans came here who then employed, Our territory have taken place but also Lapolitics because Italian governments are for NATO, a policy that has the construction of The Muos in Niscemi who is not a work of default but which is a work of exclusivity for the United States, of defense of the USA with an agreement between the then Minister of Defense and the 2006 Americaninel who has not even gone through the parliamentary discussion ... Treparabole built by destroying hectares and hectares of forest in Niscemi Satellite gluing with others that are in the Hawai, Australia and invirginia with which the killer drones are controlled and led, bases for this war in Ukraine, the muos has been used to send military transformations to NATO and hit the Russian ship that was in the Marnero… ._Precarious coop slai cobas sc</p>
<p>_ If Ukraine had not had aid from other states this warforse would not have had this outcome, would the scenario be this? _</p>
<p>Activist of the No Muos Palermo Committee and Assembly No Guerra</p>
<p>_ And 'a utopian hypothesis because there are so many interests, it is not doggi that Ukraine is surrounded ... conflicts are dictated by interest against populations, we do not look at what is right or not ègiusto, it is an escalation that It will go on, the same Pope is silenced ... I think this: we have to do a front to put a embankment in the tuttoo ... you will be able to make people become aware? IL24 and 25 there are two important events not only because there is the anniversary but because it is necessary to give an answer, the 25 will be unaamanifestation in Niscemi, the 24th is working for a procession in Palermo that also involve the world of school ... Today the marines are also elementary to make "education" see acireale ... not to mention the innovation of the threadsegnagno ... _</p>
<p>_ We have to talk to everyone, when I go shopping for example, you have to have to find an exchange to turn on a spark because they want to fall asleep ... _</p>

<p>Activist of the No Muos Palermo Committee and Assembly No Guerra</p>
<p>_Ly in operation since 2018 but the first political agreement was made in 2006, the first activists have moved to stop the Muos since 2010, with many on the front line ... _</p>
<p>School teacher worker</p>
<p>_Lavoro at school, I teach mathematics, and not much within the merits of the adidic but I do not know if there has also been a ministerial address for leeks the question of the war in a certain way, speaking with some letters of letters the setting was precisely that of Explain this Student War on the side of Ukraine ... But today I see several students who are still interested and on this it is necessary to leverage even if then that type of setting I was talking about before is also conveyed through the role some students who are headed by the institute assemblies ... _</p>

<p><strong> France. </strong> Mass protests continue to repudiate the counter -reformal control of pensions. This Saturday, more than 2.5 million people weekly in different cities of the country and this has been the third -way to the general strike after the first shares of the 19 and 31 deenero. As expected, clashes were produced between protesters and antimotines in places such as Paris, Nantes and Lyon, the balance is devarias dozens of injured activists and police, as well as more than 30 detainees. Again, the spectrum of the general strike travels the country and a new call called mobilization has been launched for March 7. In the organization, agitation and combativity of the protests, the student working youth is playing a very important role, also highlighting the pair of revolutionary organizations that raise the general strike and fall of the reactionary Emmanuel Macron under the slogans: _ continued the effort of the effort of the strike!Against pension reform, live socialist life!All power to the proletariat!_</p>

Easy, with repression, imprisonment and more homicides!This terrible is life for the popular masses in those countries where democratic freedoms and the rights of the people simply do not exist. The governments of both countries have been archirreaccionarios pursuing, criminalizing and repressing political suspenders, whether they fight by peaceful means or those who have through weapons. Prisons and cemeteries full of opponents have had the policy of both regimes for decades. Now after the earthquake of 7.7 grades of February 6, it has been confirmed that corruption is an inherent vicious of capitalism in general, and in countries where bureaucratic capitalism such as Turkey and Syria exists, this is reflected with works and works of urbanization of bad quality They have spent the invoice to Lasmasas. Buildings, constructions in general and complete cities erected by the friends of both states, have fallen as castles of cards leaving victims. According to current figures at least 19,875 people have shed in Turkey, and another 3,377 in Syria; The world organization estimates that more than 23 million people in both countries are "potentially exposed" and this is due to the lack of promptness and effectiveness in rescue and emergency work, to the collapse of health systems and the shortage of the shortage of Food, water and medicines. In a prayer: the masses are being due to the earthquake and bureaucratic capitalism. In contrast to the response of both governments, it has been to declare emergency states, to practice new political arrests to those who denounce the situation to impose military outputs.</p>

<p>Note: The following piece was <a href="https://fakemaoistabusers.wordpress.com/2023/01/29/statement-on-abuse-by-austin-maoist-activists/">released anonymously</a>on January 29th 2023. I am reposting ithere because it succinctly summarizes the most well-known abuses of theDallas-cult. I have been unable to contact the authors of this document, so ifthey are reading this and want their post removed from this website, they cancontact me at strugglesessions@protonmail.com.</p>
<p>This post is a brief summary of the extensive and serious abuses carried outby Jared Roark(aka “dallas”)and a small group of others. The basic fact isthat 15-20 people in Austin and other cities were emotionally,psychologically, and verbally abused over a period of years in organizationsJared controlled, and several people were severely traumatized. Theorganizations he controlled harbored at least one rapist.</p>
<p>This page is meant to protect people against him and other activists he islikely to be working with. These other two likely to be working with Jared areChristopher Ledesma(aka “Rico”)and Liam Swanson(“Connor”) (pictures below).Jared and these others are still seeking to carry out activism as “leftists.”Anyone who aligns with them will likely be harmed and encouraged to harmothers.</p>
<p>Jared is the founder of Red Guards Austin. He is an abusive manipulator whohas used revolutionary politics as a vehicle for his egotism and reprehensiblebehavior. Christopher and Liam have both abused people directly as well asbrought dozens of people under the influence of organizations in which abusewas systematic and pervasive. These organizations disintegrated in early 2022when the larger number of less-involved people finally learned of the deepabuse of those most involved.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone in activist spaces, especially in Austin, TX, to bevigilant against these three and anyone who defends them. Right now it’sunlikely that these three will appear in public, but a few others who supportthem may try to enter leftist spaces or carry out apparently “leftist”activism. In short, anyone who defends them or downplays their abuses shouldbe assumed to be helping them spread their influence and escapeaccountability. Anyone doing this should be publicly identified and tossed outof all activist spaces.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>To begin with: when a leader in an organization Jared controlled confessedprivately to the top leadership that he attempted to sexually assault hispartner, there was no investigation. Jared and the other leaders left this manin his leadership position and kept the secret. For at least three monthsafter this time, this individual raped two members he had leadership over.Only when this became more widely known in March 2020 did Jared expel thepredator from the movement. Jared and his top leaders never ensured anymeaningful support was offered to the survivors, and the only concern wasdetermining how to get them “back to work” in activism to promote theorganizations they ran.</p>
<p>In 2020, the mother of Jared’s child was planning on leaving theirrelationship and Jared caught wind. He collected several people most loyal tohim and convinced them she was having a mental breakdown. Together, they hidthe toddler from her and later forced her into a “struggle session,” aimingamong other things to prevent her from leaving the relationship.(In oneorganization Jared controlled, a “struggle session” was an intense session ofberatement usually rising to the level of verbal abuse in which the offenderis relentlessly gaslit and torn down by several other attendees.)This is onlyone of the most extreme examples, but Jared used his influence in the movementfor years to control his partner’s activities.</p>
<p>Many of those most traumatized have described the organizations Jared and histrusted leaders controlled as cult-like. Whether or not they counted as a cultin an official sense, it is very understandable why many who were victimizedare choosing to use that term. The environment they created was cult-like inthe following ways:</p>
<p>– There was strong encouragement for those most involved to be skepticaltoward their family, friends, and pre-existing social network, to the pointthat it was common for people to lose touch with them. Some were ordered tomove to different cities where the only people they’d know were in themovement Jared controlled. Once their support network was weakened or removed,Jared’s frequent implied threats of expulsion or isolation functioned asimplicit threats to make those most involved functionally virtually alone inthe world.</p>
<p>– Those most involved were required to seek permission for even basic lifechoices, such as who they were allowed to date romantically, and where theywere allowed to live, and were punished for deviation from these orders.– ​ Even outside of punishments, Jared and his trusted leaders gave peoplesuch a heavy activist workload, on top of having demanding full-time jobs,that for the majority of those most involved, it was the norm that they werenot getting enough sleep, often for months at a time. On top of it making itharder for people to simply think straight, it also meant they didn’t havetime or energy to socialize with friends and family, further isolating themfrom outside support.</p>
<p>– As part of the policies that were allegedly to prevent government repressionor infiltration, individuals were strongly discouraged from, or even punishedfor, airing their concerns and complaints to others who were involved, andinstead were only allowed to send them “up the chain,” ultimately to Jared andhis trusted leaders. This deepened the isolation of everyone who was mostinvolved, not just from the outside world, but even from others in their samesituation.</p>
<p>– At the beginning of most meetings among those most involved, they wereexpected to verbally swear their allegiance to the leadership of the movement…that is, to Jared and whoever his most trusted leaders were at any given time.An atmosphere of honoring leadership(Jared and his trusted leaders)wasgenerally insisted on, and failure to be sufficiently enthusiastic aboutleadership​’s decisions was treated as a bad attitude requiring punishment.</p>
<p>– There was a strong insistence that participation in the organizations underJared’s control was the one-and-only way to help liberate humanity from thevery real misery in the world, and this meant that activity outside theseorganizations accomplished almost nothing. What this meant in practice is thatthe organizations under Jared’s control were hostile to virtually all otherleftist organizations and most of their members. This also meant that thepeople most involved in the organizations under Jared’s control knew that, ifthey were viewed as “betraying” the movement(that is, disobeying Jared), theywould face the same hostility that activists outside the movement would face.In this way, the outward hostility also functioned as a sharp warning to allthose inside the movement.– Despite the lip service given that those involved should have strongconnections with the community, the real activity of the movement was to givehuge levels of energy to creating spectacles for the public to see aroundtown. This meant those most involved were often left with very little time orenergy to interact with the community, further isolating them.</p>
<p>– Methods of love-bombing and flattery were consciously used to draw peoplein.(Love-bombing is a well-known manipulation method in which someone is“bombed” with gifts, special attention, flattery, and warm treatment during aninitial honeymoon period.)Jared explicitly used this term and said it neededto be used on certain people he wanted to bring closer.</p>
<p>Taken together, this environment of mental and physical exhaustion,intimidation, manipulation, engineered ignorance, etc. gave Jared a profoundcontrol over those most involved and made it hard for them to leave, or eventhink critically about their own situation, and likely to obey Jared and histrusted leaders and help him maintain his control over others.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize, this mistreatment was carried out along sexist and anti-LGBT lines. While officially the position was equality for women and LGBTpeople, and many women were significantly involved, the reality was,traditionally feminine qualities and gender-nonconforming behavior werediscouraged or even harshly criticized. Besides his abuse of his wife, and thesexual predator who was harbored, other examples include:</p>
<p>– One of those most involved lived in Jared’s and his partner’s home as afull-time, unpaid caretaker for their child. She tried to leave multiple timesbut was manipulated and threatened with abuse each time. When she finally leftit was only when people physically helped her escape the situation andrelocate.</p>
<p>– One person who was significantly involved reported that, although theyclaimed they were transforming women to overcome the timidity that our sexistsociety often tries to enforce on women, in reality they were only changingthe main source of fear and domination, making them timid of disappointing orangering these male leaders who were usually a decade or more older than them.– One person who was involved reported that a woman involved in the movementwas criticized for coming out as a lesbian.</p>
<p>– When women who were involved would get tears in their eyes or respond in anunderstandably hurt way to the harsh verbal abuse they faced, they were toldsomething like, “You’re really emotional” as a way to invalidate theirfeelings, or accused of “pity-seeking.”</p>
<p>– An organization in the movement that had one of the highest concentration ofwomen was the main one that had its members asked to babysit Jared’s child.</p>
<p>To those that first meet him, Jared and those working with him can seem warmand caring. Jared specifically presents himself as politically knowledgeableand deeply committed to revolutionary struggle for the benefit of theexploited and oppressed. This is a facade put up during the “honeymoon phase.”At no point have Jared, Christopher, and Liam tried to make amends for, oreven acknowledged, the harm they have caused to many good people, both withinthe movement they controlled and beyond.</p>
<p>Exposing the full abuses committed by Jared and through the organizations hecontrolled is an ongoing process. Jared and his trusted leaders will nevertrust you, and they should not be trusted.</p>

<p><strong>MILAN. Report from the MFPR partner of the Nudm assembly </strong></p>
<p>On Saturday 11 February the assembly convened by Nudm Milan Conal the organization of 8 March was held.</p>
<p>The purpose of the convocation was to take or resume the contacts all that happens in the city, for their admission, and resume unlawed that had "faded" during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We were invited directly and therefore, despite the commitment for the so -called event and 41 bis, it was decided to participate.</p>
<p>My intervention, such as MFPR and worker of the Poste committed to women/workers' assembly and trade union activist for many years, has been on the proletarian women, who are facing increasingly precarious work due to the continuous changes of contracts, union eaccrondi al al Discounted where each signature is a lost right, the lechers of the work environments worsen, the ramper rhythms that cause more and more accidents, accidents and the worsening of health of health with an increase in occupational diseases that do not want anyone to want to disgust.</p>
<p>I stressed that even employees or women engaged in school or employees(See the post office)They do not pass it too well, from momentoche they have to deal with a proletarization that do not recognize or have to digest, but which see them close in a grip of commitments and Cosada to do, a real theft of time, which is subtracted e Nonricononuto because it is played on the sense of responsibility and an individual onacability is leveraged, a competition that annihilates them.</p>
<p>Individualism is good for capital, the struggle together and solidarity frightens ilcapitale, and women unite they are afraid because if they decide to unhoose or to fight they do not worry only about the job, but speak and safe on all areas of their lives</p>
<p>To those who said in the assembly of having seen the workers in the square, hossetto that workers often strike the workers, decide to attend the workplace Icancelli, to be seen, to help themselves in the struggle, as Beretta's workers today and, for example, A few years ago we were in front of the DHL gates because many workers made strikes it was important to be there for the success of the strike.I told how we are working, and I invited all both to the <strong> anti -capitalist assembly of February 18 in Rome and at the Assemblymatic Assembly of Women/Workers of February 23. </strong></p>
<p>I informed that the general strike can join all and has long been statoproclated by the Slai Cobas for the class union.</p>
<p>The youngest made themselves available to think in a way for lapartecipation of workers in the student procession of the morning(We will see)An elderly participant in the movement pointed out that we must think of women who cannot strike, like carers, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, it is good to consider everything and all, but if you want to hurt the capital of the general strike, it must be alive and concrete and this in all areas.</p>
<p><strong> Palermo. Letter of the MFPR to the Nudm companions of Palermo </strong></p>
<p>We thank you for the invitation to today's assembly.</p>
<p>We turn over the calling of the strike of March 8, 2023 which, like Slai Cobasper, the SC we did together with the women/workers platform.</p>
<p>This unfair was already made according to a double aspect:</p>
<p>One of a more technical nature as the guarantee commission in these latter years starting from 2020 has implemented a series of bureaucratic but also in fact political/ideological obstacles to prevent it on strike and/or exclude sectors of workers from Ela, attempts we have. Always postponed to the sender, also suffering repression, penalties of 5 thousand euros, but we resisted and the strike of women of March 8 was defended, claimed, affirmed every year;</p>
<p>One of a union/political/ideological nature of class in the sense that the Slaicobas for the SC is not limited and has never limited itself to proclaiming Losciopero of March 8 as a merely bureaucratic fact or for the fact that Nudm movement is asking for trade union coverage of the day for Lelavento, women, workers who want to strike, but supports/working for this strike, and since 2013 in which for the first time they were nationally on the companions of the MFPR in unity with the manylavrators and women who began to launch it at an international level and Aforlo; Women's strike in the following years the Nudm Haaa Movement and we considered this a fair and positive fact.A proclamation that does not contrast with the possible pursuit of basic other, but we hope that you have a path in which it is understood by the strike of women, not as a normal referee/category strike but as a necessary phase weapon that you look at all Lacond of exploitation and oppression at 360 degrees of the workers, of the proletarianonne, linked to a social, political/ideological condition/ideological condition but which worsens, even more today with the reactionary government, sexist, modern fascist of Meloni who wants to do the modern Middle Ages women(whose legal personality must be annihilated while that of the fetus/non -person must be affected, see the latest legal proposals)unanormality.</p>
<p>A new challenge/break against masters, government, this state state is needed. From the immediate struggles to the "bi/dreams" of the majority of the/workers for which "all life must really change", which not hannonient to be kept in this capitalist system but have every chain to daspezzi so that they are at the forefront in the struggle for a real changemocal</p>
<p>The platform that we have placed on the basis of the proclamation of the strike of 8 March is the result of all this.</p>
<p>As workers we are outlining the path that will take us to the strike of 8 March, during which there will also be a new national electronic assembly on February 23, women/female workers in which we will participate and in civi we invite.</p>
<p><strong> The letter of the Nudm companions of Palermo </strong></p>
<p>On March 8, 2023, for the seventh consecutive year, it will once again be feminist and transnational transfeminist, in a scenariooprofontally changed compared to the first strike called by not one less of March 8, 2017. Today once again we turn to the Tantissimə delegatə elavorators that in these years they have made the strikernsfemministo strike, and to that one who for the first time will want to organize it, Certə that for us all the next March 8 will be an opportunity to affirm our common pretense of freedom and self -determination, against patriarchal washing and the Poverty, discrimination, exploitation.We know that regaining the practice of the strike, for the tantə chefanno precarious works, underpaid, in black, not recognized, without times, Chenon manage to pay the bills, which are crushed every day between the work of work at home and away from home, is one Challenge, a long -term process, still difficult but we are not willing to give up. Siamoconvintə that we can collect this challenge together, with lapartecipation of all the workers, workers, delegatə that by arousing at this moment for the salary, against harassment and racismosul work place, and not to have to support the domestic work edition by the o'clock We are convinced that even the unions, both those who have joined the strike in the AnniPassati and those who have not done so, do not do and should not escape this commitment.</p>
<p><em>For this reason we believe that a comparison with all the trade union realities in our city is necessary to build the feminist and transfeminist strike together.</em></p>
<p>*Sietə tuttə Invitatə at the city assembly to be held next Saturday 4th February at 6 pm at the Auaar headquarters(Via Matteo Bonello, 39).</p>

<h1>PC February 13 - "Stop the world war escalation" - an assembly at the GKN - the intervention of communist proletarians</h1>

<p>A hundred companions and companions participated yesterday in the "Stopping's Well -Well -Bellic escalation" held in the GKN occupied factory.</p>
<p>In the morning there were a series of reports of process political organizations already participating in a previous conference against the Warimperialist war were followed by those of Insormo Bologna, NO Basecolano Committee, Calp Genova and, registered, an intervention by the international meeting Frankfurt for the Trans-National Social Strike.</p>
<p>All the relationships have wondered why at the moment the forces that came down the war on a coherently anti -imperialist position and to clarify still too narrow and not able to develop an action that actually the participation of Italy and the endless repercussions of attacks under the conditions of life of the masses and how to overcome impasse.</p>
<p>But, everyone repeated with more or less emphasis that it was not task or allegedly claimed to reach a synthesis of the analyzes and proposed indications, nor a more "heavy" form ". The goal that took place was "return" of the effort of analysis and struggle paths made by the Daciascuno, persisted in the "convergence" method, in the perspective that extending and growth of the collective imagination of southern econvergers, each shared in the His ways and places, finally reaches assets of mutual differences and mistrust, change the relationships of strength and fine winning.</p>

<p><strong> Intervention by the Slai Cobas SC in Bergamo at the Delsi.Cobas electronic assembly of 12.02 </strong></p>
<p>We greet all the companions the organizations and workers present at this assembly. We participated in the spirit that it is necessary to extend to edele the mobilization given that the fight against the inter-imperialist war is one of the most concrete and important struggles at this moment.</p>
<p>The problem that we must fight against our imperialism is a thing to be clarified by the active role that our imperialism that is not only to be a faithful servant of NATO Edegli USA but at the service of the Italian masters who have interests in thisguerra, Like the sale of weapons, such as reconstruction, it also interests the resources to divide and make profits on our skin, see/Gas, Italy Gas/Mediterranean hub. Not to mention that there is an imperialist policy of our Diespansionism government, just see the activism of the Meloni government in Algeria Edegitto.</p>
<p>For this battle against the imperialist war and also on how to bring the goal that was said in the introduction: "Peace to the oppressed Eguerra to the oppressors", you have to start from a problem</p>
<p>Basically, and since it was mentioned by other Lenin, we resume this step: "We understand the inevitable link of the wars with the struggle of the classinel of within each country and therefore we understand the impossibility of the wars without destroying the classes and building Socialism Equinde the legitimacy of the wars of the oppressed class against the cheopprime "</p>
<p>Having said that, the center of the initiative is how we fight against the active role of our imperialism, and against this government that is carrying out nationalist nationalist about a fascist ideological propaganda, also attracted to the action, in support of the Italian economy, of the confederalized in the factories ad for Fooding the workers' aristocracy, which lives of the imperialism resulting from the exploitation of peoples, to divide the working class.On the days of 24 and 25 February, the anniversary of the intervention of Russian imperialism in Ukraine, but within an inter-imperialist preparation by the USA/NATO using the Nazi Nazi Trojan horse of Zelenski, we are for a mobilization of the Internationalist and Popular Struggle.</p>
<p>So on the 24th the initiatives will be done on the jobs to make ILAVORATORS SCRIPE AGAINST THE GOVERN WAR PROPARADANDA, until you get to act initiatives, stops and strikes.</p>
<p>The instrument of the worker motion with collection of signatures that started in multiple 10 factories is a tool to make the analysis of the situation and forces on the field take position, to put the link between the imperialist lajorra and the class struggle, while it continues The attack of the Meloni with the daily war on the proletarians who fight, also with the increase in repression.</p>
<p>As for February 25 and the events, we will see Comractive to the initiatives that can have a local, regional, or national character including that of Genoa where a sector of workers is stamped, to do our part for participation in the realities we have to present</p>
<p>To fight against the active role of our imperialism, the mobilization of combative workers is essential but it is not enough, the political struggle of masters and the government is needed through the tool of the single front of classyanticapian and anti -imperialist who gives the tools to the proletarians percondoning the war on war, because the Problem is always the one where she is the same and today even more with the imperialist war: the need to tell a political front to make war against our oppressors.</p>
<p>On this we all invite to continue the discussion and the comparison of the anti -capitalist proletarian assembly of Rome on 18 February at the Spaziometropoliz from 1030 to 1830.</p>

<p>02/13/2023</p>
<p>At least 250,000 people mobilized last Sunday, February 12, Enmadrid for the defense of public health against the cuts and continuing of the public health system led by the president of the Lacomunity of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Different media outlets, both large and small, have spread images and news about Lamarcha.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-35-36-00-00/image-7.png" /><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-35-36-00-00/image-6.png" />The mobilization, which occurred in the center of the city and paralyzed the capital of the country, is part of the struggles of the health workers and users, mainly the proletariat of the southern zone Demadrid, that is, neighborhoods workers Like Vallecas, Usera or Orcasitas, Entremachos others(click here](https://serviralpuebloperiodico.wordpress.com/2023/01/16/ola-de-huelgas-sanitarias-en-todo-el-estado-espanol/)To read «<em> <strong> OLA of Strikesanitary Strikes throughout the Spanish State </strong> </em>«)The Government of the Popular Party, nervous because 2023 is a year of farcetoral both at the regional level for the Community of Madrid and for general elections, tries to unlink the mobilization of the workers of health towards a "maneuver orchestrated by the left." Enriqueossorio, spokesman for the Community of Madrid, has declared: “<em> They are try(…)_You have to take a look at the calls we see today in the demonstration: Green Marea, Assembly 15M, Union of Studies, Feminist of the 8M, railway union, associations that nodat that to do with health, to see that it is a political strike</em> "</p>
<p>This statement is clumsy, because it tries to criminalize the strike saying that a political objective is. Naturally!The words of the spokesman thin suggests that the bourgeois parties, managers of the Spanish oligarchyfinanciera, are afraid that the masses organize and fight more of their union claims and acquire awareness of the fighting struggle and the need for the struggle for power.</p>

<p>Reproduced article <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2023/02/11/el-istmo-de-tehuantepec-bajo-ataque/">Periodicomural</a>, published on 03/11/2023</p>
<p>In recent days, an observation mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commission in Mexico visited the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and can verify them increasing aggressions against ejidatarios, community South is permanent: the violence of the State against Susopositores.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, these aggressions intensified after the Sarabia Station Equidatarios expel and suspicious of at least two murders among other crimes of federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The employees of "La Peninsular" did work on the roads Dolpherro.(Semar)that withdrew the blockages by force, intimidating the population.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-54-10-00-00/istmo-onu1.jpeg" />A maximum of the revolutionary Mao Tse Tung expresses that _ "where there is oppressionhay resistance" _ And so it happened, the ejidatarios reorganized, and with the support of other ejidos and towns in the region, they expelled the company and the sailors again. As reported by the Union of Indigenous Communities of the Northern Area of the Isthmus(Ucis), since then they are ... _ “overwhelmed by military occupation; Diario there are seals in the area of Access to the Ucizoni offices ”._</p>
<p>Indeed, today the Government of the Republic has deployed more than 4 thousand elements of Semar in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Desdecoatzacoalcos, Veracruz, to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. According to the Universal Periódico, the sailors _ "seek to contain protests and blockages of social organizations that oppose the interoceanic" _ [1].The wooden bridge assembly states that the area of affectation is of usocomún and that the procedure for transfer of rights was plagued by a regularities through a rigged communal assembly where _ “even the women voted” _. Behind this imposition is the former municipal president of San Blas Atempa and current secretary of Delgo -government administration of the State of Oaxaca, Antonino Morales Toledo who has been investigated in the "Blue Agave Operation" [2]. His brother César Morales Toledo(a)"Santa" is held as president of the Commissariat of Communal Assets, although it is said, the Assembly who appointed him was not legitimate.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-54-10-00-00/istmo-onu2.jpeg" />Only last January 17, the communal David Hernández Salazar, Municipal Agent of Puente Madera, was suddenly arrested by research agents when he headed to his work center; He was led to the prison of Tanivet, Oaxaca, where he was made available to a control judge who linked him to the process and released under precautionary measures in intense protests that demanded the immediate release of him.</p>
<p>The Assembly of the Indigenous Peoples of the Isthmus in Defense of the Earth and Elterritorio(Apide)They have denounced that in addition to this, there are another 14 orders for apprehension against the same number of people for their opposition that consider a dispossession. As a repetitive pattern, Apiidtt points out that they have detected… _ “The presence of a man ofrobust complexion, blue shirt, denim pants, boots and possibly armed, was recharged on the wall, watching who entered and left the office, through the cameras we saw that he had been spinning in front of the office from noon ”_ [3].</p>
<p>But to the official violence of the State is added its unofficial career(leaseygal).</p>
<p>El fantasma del paramilitarismo vuelve a ceñirse sobre los pueblos que seoponen al Corredor Interoceánico del Istmo de Tehuantepec (Ciit)and under the design of an alleged social organization called _ “Unique Front Oaxunities” _(Fuch)All kinds of crimes as dispossession, extortion, threats, attacks and homicides are being committed.</p>
<p>The Agrarian Community of Santa Cruz Tagolaba, located in Tehuantepec, is elblanco of these attacks. At least three important data serve toilustrate it:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-54-10-00-00/istmo-onu3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>On October 27, 2022, an armed group arrived at the home of Ericsánchez Gutiérrez, Zapoteco community of Santa Cruz Tagolaba and leader of the Current of the Red People(Red CP-Sol); There he lost his lifestyle of the name of Jesús Manuel García Martínez "Chu Pau", while Queico was seriously injured. Both headed the fight against theimposition of the CIIT and the defense of the community of the community before the Olade disposses committed by _ “tacho” _ and his brother, who is now claimed by the Commissariat of Communal Assets, although according to a substance measure issued by the Court Unitary Agrarian is not, nor is there legally recognized in Santa Cruz Tagolaba due to the social conflicts generated by Fuco, which despite being a morenista organization has been sidered by AMLO as _ “poster of the dispossession” _.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-54-10-00-00/istmo-onu4.jpeg" />Finally, on January 29, 2023, armed subjects aboard at least 10 trucks, commanded by the brothers _ “Tacho basket and Sergio Canalla”(Rinconcito), belonging to the communalBienes of Santa Cruz Tagolaba. There they destroyed irrigation hoses, posts, fences, orchards and other belongings of the peasant families who lived hours of terror at the rain of shots that percuss the paramilitaries. Despite the calls for help to different government authorities, the aggressors left in impunity threatening to return [4].</p>
<p>Once again, repeating this pattern, the Red CP-Sol has denounced that… _ “Unknown, embozados and armed subjects travel through the communal house, the community of the community and the roads as patrolling and intimidating, while the National Guard only contemplates”. _</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SERVIR AL PUEBLO/2023-02-13T15-54-10-00-00/istmo-onu5.jpeg" />These and other expressions of the harassment climate, harassment, repression andterror have been collected in broad testimonies by the UN Office of the UN altocommitted in Mexico, which for several days closely accompanied Aucizoni, Apiidtt and CP-Sol Red. The common feeling of the eighteenth dozens interviewed is that the <em>cuatroteista</em> model will impose the corridor with which the conqueror Hernán Cortés dreamed in the middle delgenocidio, and that was frustrated by the fierce resistance of the organic peoples who rose in arms one and again.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong> Earn Folket Media now publishes a collection of articles and news cases that February 24 is 1 year since the full -scale invasion of Ukraine gigne. </strong></p>
<p>The Russian imperialist war war has demanded hundreds of thousands of life and driven fifteen million people on the run. This is the biggest war in Ieurope since World War II, and a defining turning point in our time. The main aspect of the war is the contradiction between Russian imperialism and the Ukrainian nation. This is the main thing, but we also do not see from other subordinate aspects: the role of the US imperialism, the role played by imperialists, the rivalry between the imperialists and the character of the Zeleneskyj government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tjen-folket.no/index.php/krigen-i-ukraina/">The war in Ukraine</a>The revolutionary movement leads a political struggle against Russian imperialism to reveal it. Earn Folk Media will give our readers the opportunity to get an overview of the situation. In this text collection can be seen what we have published about the historical background of the war, and the re -preparation of the full -scale invasion. Here you can read about the development of the war and the revolutionary movement's position on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also refer to a number of articles on the context of the war. First, the context of the rivalry between the imperialists in the struggle for influence idea old colonies and the semi -colonies of Soviet social imperialism. For the second: the context of the rivalry globally, especially between the United States, as well as the development trend in all the bourgeois states that are currently in line. Militarization and reaction.</p>
<p>The collection side also refers to activities against the war from the revolutionary movement, and to articles on the influence of the war on the inner contradictions of the party Red. No other parties have been so changed by this war, and the party has long been the only party with a certain opposition to the complete support of the Norwegian imperialism to the United States-Nato line facing theukraine. This makes this particularly interesting.</p>
<p>The collection side is designed to be used, and we hope our readers and the movement of the soreness will benefit from it, for studies and meetings, and for inspiration for activity.</p>

An adventure that, in addition to the devastating consequences it brings to the people of the Ukrainian, threatens the lives of peoples all over the region as the US-NATO and Russia imperialists are determined to continue and put it on the table and escalating it.
