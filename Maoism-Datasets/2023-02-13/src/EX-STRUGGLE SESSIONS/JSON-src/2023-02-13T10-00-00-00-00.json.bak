I am reposting ithere because it succinctly summarizes the most well-known abuses of theDallas-cult. I have been unable to contact the authors of this document, so ifthey are reading this and want their post removed from this website, they cancontact me at strugglesessions@protonmail.com.\n\nThis post is a brief summary of the extensive and serious abuses carried outby Jared Roark (aka “Dallas”) and a small group of others. The basic fact isthat 15-20 people in Austin and other cities were emotionally,psychologically, and verbally abused over a period of years in organizationsJared controlled, and several people were severely traumatized. Theorganizations he controlled harbored at least one rapist.\n\nThis page is meant to protect people against him and other activists he islikely to be working with. These other two likely to be working with Jared areChristopher Ledesma (aka “Rico”) and Liam Swanson (“Connor”) (pictures below).Jared and these others are still seeking to carry out activism as “leftists.”Anyone who aligns with them will likely be harmed and encouraged to harmothers.\n\nJared is the founder of Red Guards Austin. He is an abusive manipulator whohas used revolutionary politics as a vehicle for his egotism and reprehensiblebehavior. Christopher and Liam have both abused people directly as well asbrought dozens of people under the influence of organizations in which abusewas systematic and pervasive. These organizations disintegrated in early 2022when the larger number of less-involved people finally learned of the deepabuse of those most involved.\n\nWe encourage everyone in activist spaces, especially in Austin, TX, to bevigilant against these three and anyone who defends them. Right now it’sunlikely that these three will appear in public, but a few others who supportthem may try to enter leftist spaces or carry out apparently “leftist”activism. In short, anyone who defends them or downplays their abuses shouldbe assumed to be helping them spread their influence and escapeaccountability. Anyone doing this should be publicly identified and tossed outof all activist spaces.\n\nAs a final note before going further, we want to say we do not believe thisabuse has anything significant to do with the fact that these individualsclaim to follow Marxism or Maoism. Anyone who has honestly observed the USleft for any significant time knows that abusers have flown under the cover ofa great variety of leftist ideas.\n\n….\n\nTo begin with: when a leader in an organization Jared controlled confessedprivately to the top leadership that he attempted to sexually assault hispartner, there was no investigation. Jared and the other leaders left this manin his leadership position and kept the secret. For at least three monthsafter this time, this individual raped two members he had leadership over.Only when this became more widely known in March 2020 did Jared expel thepredator from the movement. Jared and his top leaders never ensured anymeaningful support was offered to the survivors, and the only concern wasdetermining how to get them “back to work” in activism to promote theorganizations they ran.\n\nIn 2020, the mother of Jared’s child was planning on leaving theirrelationship and Jared caught wind. He collected several people most loyal tohim and convinced them she was having a mental breakdown. Together, they hidthe toddler from her and later forced her into a “struggle session,” aimingamong other things to prevent her from leaving the relationship. (In oneorganization Jared controlled, a “struggle session” was an intense session ofberatement usually rising to the level of verbal abuse in which the offenderis relentlessly gaslit and torn down by several other attendees.) This is onlyone of the most extreme examples, but Jared used his influence in the movementfor years to control his partner’s activities.\n\nMany of those most traumatized have described the organizations Jared and histrusted leaders controlled as cult-like. Whether or not they counted as a cultin an official sense, it is very understandable why many who were victimizedare choosing to use that term. The environment they created was cult-like inthe following ways:\n\n– There was strong encouragement for those most involved to be skepticaltoward their family, friends, and pre-existing social network, to the pointthat it was common for people to lose touch with them. Some were ordered tomove to different cities where the only people they’d know were in themovement Jared controlled. Once their support network was weakened or removed,Jared’s frequent implied threats of expulsion or isolation functioned asimplicit threats to make those most involved functionally virtually alone inthe world.\n\n– Those most involved were required to seek permission for even basic lifechoices, such as who they were allowed to date romantically, and where theywere allowed to live, and were punished for deviation from these orders.\n\n– People who disobeyed Jared or his trusted leader’s commands, or failed tomeet the often impossible expectations, would often face harsh and demeaningverbal abuse, and/or physically strenuous punishments. The most extremepunishments also included the “struggle sessions” described above. Often, noexceptions were made for these strenuous punishments even if someone wasalready in poor physical health at the time.\n\n– \u200b Even outside of punishments, Jared and his trusted leaders gave peoplesuch a heavy activist workload, on top of having demanding full-time jobs,that for the majority of those most involved, it was the norm that they werenot getting enough sleep, often for months at a time. On top of it making itharder for people to simply think straight, it also meant they didn’t havetime or energy to socialize with friends and family, further isolating themfrom outside support.\n\n– As part of the policies that were allegedly to prevent government repressionor infiltration, individuals were strongly discouraged from, or even punishedfor, airing their concerns and complaints to others who were involved, andinstead were only allowed to send them “up the chain,” ultimately to Jared andhis trusted leaders. This deepened the isolation of everyone who was mostinvolved, not just from the outside world, but even from others in their samesituation.\n\n– At the beginning of most meetings among those most involved, they wereexpected to verbally swear their allegiance to the leadership of the movement…that is, to Jared and whoever his most trusted leaders were at any given time.An atmosphere of honoring leadership (Jared and his trusted leaders) wasgenerally insisted on, and failure to be sufficiently enthusiastic aboutleadership\u200b’s decisions was treated as a bad attitude requiring punishment.\n\n– There was a strong insistence that participation in the organizations underJared’s control was the one-and-only way to help liberate humanity from thevery real misery in the world, and this meant that activity outside theseorganizations accomplished almost nothing. What this meant in practice is thatthe organizations under Jared’s control were hostile to virtually all otherleftist organizations and most of their members. This also meant that thepeople most involved in the organizations under Jared’s control knew that, ifthey were viewed as “betraying” the movement (that is, disobeying Jared), theywould face the same hostility that activists outside the movement would face.In this way, the outward hostility also functioned as a sharp warning to allthose inside the movement.\n\n– Though this was not known to all those involved, Jared and his trustedleaders actively kept tabs on anyone who left the movement, including knowingor even monitoring their residence and workplace. It was not uncommon to hearthose who left or were expelled from the movement denounced as “traitors” and“enemies.” The message was clear to those involved: if you dissent toostrongly or leave, you will have reason to be afraid.\n\n– Despite the lip service given that those involved should have strongconnections with the community, the real activity of the movement was to givehuge levels of energy to creating spectacles for the public to see aroundtown. This meant those most involved were often left with very little time orenergy to interact with the community, further isolating them.\n\n– Methods of love-bombing and flattery were consciously used to draw peoplein. (Love-bombing is a well-known manipulation method in which someone is“bombed” with gifts, special attention, flattery, and warm treatment during aninitial honeymoon period.) Jared explicitly used this term and said it neededto be used on certain people he wanted to bring closer.\n\nTaken together, this environment of mental and physical exhaustion,intimidation, manipulation, engineered ignorance, etc. gave Jared a profoundcontrol over those most involved and made it hard for them to leave, or eventhink critically about their own situation, and likely to obey Jared and histrusted leaders and help him maintain his control over others.\n\nWe want to emphasize, this mistreatment was carried out along sexist and anti-LGBT lines. While officially the position was equality for women and LGBTpeople, and many women were significantly involved, the reality was,traditionally feminine qualities and gender-nonconforming behavior werediscouraged or even harshly criticized. Besides his abuse of his wife, and thesexual predator who was harbored, other examples include:\n\n– One of those most involved lived in Jared’s and his partner’s home as afull-time, unpaid caretaker for their child. She tried to leave multiple timesbut was manipulated and threatened with abuse each time. When she finally leftit was only when people physically helped her escape the situation andrelocate.\n\n– One person who was significantly involved reported that, although theyclaimed they were transforming women to overcome the timidity that our sexistsociety often tries to enforce on women, in reality they were only changingthe main source of fear and domination, making them timid of disappointing orangering these male leaders who were usually a decade or more older than them.\n\n– In general, less severe male sexual misconduct (eg, inappropriate sexualconversations) was overlooked and treated lightly as long as it was carriedout by someone Jared and his trusted leaders found useful. An example of thisis when Jared defended a man that cheated on his partner by pursuing avulnerable young female activist that was under this man’s leadership.\n\n– One person who was involved reported that a woman involved in the movementwas criticized for coming out as a lesbian.\n\n– When women who were involved would get tears in their eyes or respond in anunderstandably hurt way to the harsh verbal abuse they faced, they were toldsomething like, “You’re really emotional” as a way to invalidate theirfeelings, or accused of “pity-seeking.”\n\n– An organization in the movement that had one of the highest concentration ofwomen was the main one that had its members asked to babysit Jared’s child.\n\nTo those that first meet him, Jared and those working with him can seem warmand caring. Jared specifically presents himself as politically knowledgeableand deeply committed to revolutionary struggle for the benefit of theexploited and oppressed. This is a facade put up during the “honeymoon phase.”At no point have Jared, Christopher, and Liam tried to make amends for, oreven acknowledged, the harm they have caused to many good people, both withinthe movement they controlled and beyond.\n\nExposing the full abuses committed by Jared and through the organizations hecontrolled is an ongoing process. Jared and his trusted leaders will nevertrust you, and they should not be trusted.', 'source': 'https://struggle-sessions.com/2023/02/13/statement-on-abuse-by-austin-maoist-activists-repost/'}
