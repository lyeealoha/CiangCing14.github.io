The leaflets also condemned the terror committed against the Mexicanpeople in the state of Oaxaca, against the poor peasants who are resisting theimperialist mega-projects being developed in the area.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/1-3.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThe activists held a banner reading "Down with the criminalization of thestruggle for land!" in both Danish and Portuguese.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/2-4.jpg?w=1024)![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/3-3.jpg?w=1024)\n\nDemands that the terror against the people of Brazil and Mexico be stoppedwere hung at the entrance of the embassy, while battle cries in support of theLCP were shouted.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/4-2.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThe Anti-Imperialist Collective also organised a protest in front of theMexican Embassy, where the same leaflets were distributed. The activists helda banner with the slogan "Freedom for all political prisoners!" whiledemanding that all disappeared people\'s fighters from Mexico and Brazil bepresented alive, while at the same time condemning the murders of the murderedpeople\'s fighters.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/5-2.jpg?w=1024)\n\nThe activists report that during the protest, a company of Brazilianbusinessmen, one of them the owner of a large Brazilian agrarian company,appeared. The owner of the agrarian company recognised the slogans in supportof the LCP and was shocked that the LCP also enjoys the support in animperialist country like Denmark.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/6-2.jpg?w=1024)\n\nIn the proletarian neighbourhood of Blågården, a banner condemning themassacre of poor peasants in Brazil was hung up.\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/7-2.jpg?w=1024)![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/8-2.jpg?w=1024)\n\nWe have received the leaflets distributed in front of both embassies andreproduce them below:\n\n![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/9-2.jpg?w=1024)![](https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/10-2.jpg?w=1024)\n\n_Proletarians of all countries, unite!_\n\n## **Stop the terror against the Mexican people!**   **Stop the terror against the poor peasants in Brazil!**\n\nIn the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, the poor peasants have beenfighting for years against mega-projects that the old state is building incooperation with the imperialists. The peasants are being robbed of their landso that huge wind farms can be built on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In thisway, the peasants are expropriated, nature is destroyed and the population isdisplaced.\n\nThe resistance that the peasants have been putting up for years is being metwith repression and terror by the old Mexican state and its henchmen. In orderto break the struggle of the peasants and the different popular movements thathave taken up the task of developing resistance against the imperialist mega-projects, the state is setting paramilitary murder gangs on the population.This situation has worsened drastically in the last few weeks. Severalpeople\'s militants have been arrested or disappeared without trace. On the29th of January 2023, armed paramilitaries acting on behalf of the biglandowners occupied the community of Rincon Tagolaba threatening theresidents, destroying cultivated land and drinking water pipes and firingshots to intimidate them. The national police arrived but did nothing againstthe heavily armed paramilitaries.\n\nThe Mexican state, with the help of the murderous gangs that work for it, isenforcing the interests of the imperialists at the expense of the people ofthe Isthmus of Tehuantepec and any means will do. Our solidarity is with thestruggling poor peasants and the popular movements, such as the People’sCurrent Red Sun (Corriente del Pueblo Sol Rojo), which fights tirelessly andsacrificially for the needs and interests of the people. **We demand therelease of all imprisoned fighters of the people. We demand the immediate livepresentation of the disappeared. We demand an end to the repression and terrorof the old Mexican state and its henchmen.**\n\n* * *\n\nIn addition, news reached us of another massacre of poor peasants in theBrazilian state of Rondônia, once again perpetrated by the local biglandowners. The two farmers Rodrigo and Raniel were tortured and murdered in abestial way. Both were found extremely violated. Pictures of Raniel\'s bodyshow that a large piece of his skull has been knocked out. The pictures of thetwo are frightening and show the brutality with which the Brazilian state andthe big landowning class are acting against revolutionary forces.\n\nThe League of Poor Peasants (LCP) has been fighting for a long time in theregion for a piece of land for all poor and landless peasants from which theycan support themselves and their families. Time and again there are massacresby the Brazilian state, the big landowners and their henchmen. In April 2021,the Brazilian state carried out a massacre in Santa Elina, in the ManoelRibero camp, where several peasants were murdered. For days and weeks, thecamp was terrorised, isolated from the outside world and sealed off. Theentire camp, where the collective life and work of the poor peasants wasorganised on land they occupied, was razed to the ground. Nevertheless, thestruggle of the LCP and the poor and landless peasants organised in itcontinued.\n\n**Therefore, then as now, we call on all friends of the Brazilian people andthe LCP to participate in the rally and denounce and condemn these renewedmurders!**\n\n**We declare eternal honor and glory to the fallen comrades in the strugglefor land  We demand punishment for the executors and commissioners of the murders of thepeople\'s fighters!**\n\n**Stop the terror against the Brazilian People!**\n\n**Stop the terror against the Mexican People!**\n\n**Stop the criminalisation of the struggle for land!**\n\n**Long live the LCP and Corriente del Pueblo Sol Rojo!**\n\nAnti-Imperialist Collective  February, 2023\n\n[AIKollektiv@protonmail.com](mailto:AIKollektiv@protonmail.com)\n\nSocialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com', 'categories': ['Uncategorized'], 'source': 'https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2023/02/12/copenhagen-report-of-actions-in-solidarity-with-the-lcp-and-corriente-del-pueblo-sol-rojo/'}
