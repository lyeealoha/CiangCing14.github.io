#Derry Revolutionary Socialist Republicans took part in this years Bloody
Sunday march in Derry.

On the 30th January 1972 peaceful civil rights protestors defying British rule
in Ireland organised and marched against internment in Ireland. 14 Irish
citizens were murdered by the British army's parachute regiment.

Revolutionary Socialist Republicans carried banners with "We Serve Neither
King nor Kaiser but Ireland" which was well received by on lookers who clapped
at the Revolutionary Socialist Republican message.

A banner commemorating the Irish Republicans execucted by Counter
Revolutionaries in 1922-23 was also carried along with a banner from the Anti
Internment Campaign.

History has shown that as long as Britian occupies Ireland innocent people
will die.

British rule must always be resisted and the all Ireland Republic of 1916
defended.

No more Bloody Sundays! End British Rule in Ireland!
