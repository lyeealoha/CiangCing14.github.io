Quetiapine Increased risk of death due to dementia-related psychosis.Increased risk of suicidal thoughts.\n\nVenlafaxine is contraindicated if it causes worsening suicidal ideation,depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Caution is advisable in heart failurepatients, hyperthyroidism, and those with recent myocardial infarctions as itcan raise blood pressure and increase heart rate\n\nAnti-Imperialist Action like other Irish Republican groups not only recognisethe threat that drug dealers pose to our communities but also the use of suchindividuals by the State.\n\nRevolutionary Republicans will always stand with the Community!', 'categories': ['AIA'], 'type': 'article', 'source': 'https://anti-imperialist-action-ireland.com/blog/2023/02/10/anti-imperialist-action-munster-remove-dangerous-drugs-from-the-community/'}
