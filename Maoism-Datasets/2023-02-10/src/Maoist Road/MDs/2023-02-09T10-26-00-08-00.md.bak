**  ****Communist Party of the Philippines**    February 8, 2023



We mark today the 84th birth anniversary of Prof. Jose Maria Sison, foundingchair of the Communist Party of the Philippines, fully conscious of thecontinuing profound significance of Ka Joma's work in the unremitting struggleof the Filipino people for national democracy and socialism, which form partof the international anti-imperialist resistance of all oppressed andexploited peoples.

In celebrating his revolutionary life and work, let us reaffirm our adherenceto the universal correctness of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and its application tothe concrete conditions of the Philippines as practiced and taught by Ka Joma,and as embodied in the principles, policies and program of the Communist Partyof the Philippines. Let us also look forward to the 130th birth anniversary ofChairman Mao Zedong later this year and Ka Joma's 85th birth anniversary nextyear by studying with all energy the classic writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin,Stalin, Mao, Ho as well as those of Ka Joma, and using them as guide as wecarry forward with all vigor the national democratic revolution.

As founding chair and guide of the CPP, Ka Joma incisively analyzed thesemicolonial and semifeudal conditions in the country and pointed to thenecessity of carrying out a people's democratic revolution by wagingprotracted people's war along the strategy of encircling the cities from thecountryside.

Wielding both the New People's Army and the National Democratic Front as swordand shield respectively, the Party has achieved myriad revolutionary successesover more than five decades. The victories accumulated in waging resistanceand building revolutionary power are testament to the correctness and lastingvalidity of Ka Joma's teachings and to the indefatigable determination of theParty's cadres to carry forward the tasks of the Philippine revolution.

Inspired by Ka Joma's boundless revolutionary optimism, the Party and allpatriotic and democratic forces are determined to bring the nationaldemocratic revolution to final victory, no matter the sacrifice and howeverlong it takes. The liberation of the Filipino people from imperialism,feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism hinges on winning the revolution.

The passing away of Ka Joma on December 16, 2022 was a profound loss to theParty. Still, his revolutionary spirit and the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist writings which he bequeathed continue to unite the Party andimbue it with strength. His death has inspired a revolutionary educationmovement among Party cadres and activists to study his teachings in order toraise their knowledge of revolutionary theory and history, and to sum-up andguide their revolutionary practice in the field of revolutionary armedstruggle and mass movement in the cities and countryside.

This study movement is characterized by a review of the basic principles ofthe Party as laid out by Ka Joma in the first and second great rectificationmovements. Party cadres are also carrying out further research and socialinvestigation to enrich and deepen understanding of the semicolonial andsemifeudal conditions of the people.

Through this study movement, leading committees of the Party have takeninitiative in self-criticism efforts to identify, root out, repudiate andrectify errors of subjectivism which have impeded the growth of therevolutionary movement and weakened it in some parts. The level ofrevolutionary energy and enthusiasm is steadily rising, and with it, theFilipino people's determination to carry forward the revolution.

In the field of armed struggle, Party cadres in the New People's Army areexerting efforts to surmount the problem of self-constriction in order toconsistently expand and deepen the mass base and take the initiative inmounting annihilative tactical offensives combined with widespread attritivetactical offensives. In the field of the mass movement in both the cities andcountryside, revolutionary forces are overcoming problems of reformism,legalism and conservatism in order to expand the people's organized strength,lead their democratic struggles, raise their struggles against imperialistneoliberal policies and military intervention, and link and extend support tothe armed struggle.

A vigorous study movement of Ka Joma's teachings is bound to take root amongthe Filipino youth and students, ensuring the emergence of a new generation ofrevolutionaries and communists who will lead the Party and carry forward therevolution into the future. The campaign to promote Marxism-Leninism-Maoismand a culture of revolutionary collectivism and selfless service to thepeople, especially among young intellectuals, direct challenges the culture ofsocial apathy, individualism, self-centeredness, hedonism and other rottenanti-social traits being promoted by imperialism and the ruling classes inmedia and social media.

During Ka Joma's lifetime, the reactionary ruling classes did all they can tosuppress and silence him. With his death, the reactionaries are now foreverhaunted by his red specter. Mortally fearful of the national democraticrevolution, the Philippine reactionary government, representing the interestsof the imperialists, the big bourgeois compradors and big landlords, continuesto employ to brutal state terrorism and fascist suppression in a futile effortto stop the forward march of the Filipino people and their revolution. Theyhave resorted to placing entire villages under military rule, dropping half-ton bombs from the air, extrajudicial killings, torture, abducting pregnantwomen and children, fake surrenders, and endlessly spinning lies. Theirrepeated declaration of having defeated the revolutionary movement is set toexplode in their face as the Party, the NPA and the NDF gain strength andcarry the revolution to greater heights.

The viciousness with which the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) wages itscounter-revolution, however, succeeds only in further exposing the rottennessof the ruling system. Fascist violence is inciting the broad masses of thepeople to fight back. It shows them that there is no path to attain theiraspiration for justice and freedom other than the revolutionary mass movementand armed struggle.

Amid aggravation of the crisis of overproduction of the global capitalistsystem, the leading imperialists powers are resorting to wars and pushing theentire world towards the brink of widespread death and destruction. Theconditions of great disorder and turbulence being generated by the globalcapitalist system is compelling the proletariat to rise up and lead theoppressed and exploited classes to wage revolution.

Guided by Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and the teachings of Ka Joma, the CommunistParty of the Philippines vows to persevere in leading the Filipino peoplealong the path of the national democratic revolution. Together with risinganti-imperialist and antifascist struggles around the world, the Party isdetermined to contribute to the resurgence of socialist and new democraticrevolutions worldwide and help forge a new period in the world history of theproletariat.
