<p><strong>LET 'S DEVELOPE THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST WORLDWAR PREPARATIONS!</strong></p>
<p>--DECLARATION--</p>
<p>All the imperialist countries proclaim to be defenders of freedom, democracyand world peace. They all pretext to fight against dictatorships andinternational terrorism. But, indeed, they are the worst te\rrorist dictatorsin the world. They speak about peace but frantically prepare for a new war ofglobal robbery. They strengthen the arms industry. They increase theirarsenals. They mobilize huge war machines mainly towards Eastern Europe. Theysponsor the already prolonged wars against the peoples of Palestine, Syria,Yemen. They are inciting the outbreak of new reactionary wars in the TaiwanStrait, on the Korean peninsula, in the East China Sea, on the Ukrainian-Belarus border, on the sea border between Greece and Turkey. NATO, commandedby Yankee imperialism, in Ukraine through the puppet regime of Kiev, confrontsits mercenary armies, weapons and military chiefs, with the military might ofRussian imperialism. Both sides concoct pretexts to use nuclear weapons. Theinter-imperialist contradictions sharpened to the point that a new nuclearworld war is no longer a latent imperialist danger, but an imminent risk forthe existence of world society and its habitat.</p>
<p>BasicallyThe ongoing proxy wars and trade wars, the emerging trade blocs andmilitary blocks, allotment of heavy military budgets, manufacturing colossaland mass destructive weapons, modernizing military forces and several types ofpreparations for world war even in space shows the neck and neck competitionfor the economic resources and political control over the countries of Asia,Africa and Latin America including several east European countries. All theseindicate the intensifying inter-imperialist contradictions and the scramblefor the re division of markets and world hegemony.</p>
<p>The world imperialist system, decadent and decomposed, in its inevitable one-way march towards the grave, has unloaded on society the terrible consequencesof the increasingly acute world economic crisis, and with it, has extended anddeepened in all continents social, health and environmental crises. For theinsatiable imperialists, the monopolization and accumulation of capital at thecost of the global exploitation of social labor, the usurious export offinancial capital, the destruction of nature, the plundering of the oppressedcountries, is not enough. The crises of their system, mainly the economic one,impel the imperialists to carry out a new division of the already dividedworld. A new division that can only be achieved by economic force, financialforce, military force, the force of the world war between a few imperialistcountries in decline and others fighting for world hegemony, as a product ofthe inexorable economic law of the uneven development of the imperialistcountries.</p>
<p>But the same economic and social causes that push the imperialists to wars ofrobbery, become unlivable, unbearable material conditions for the slaves ofcapital, material conditions of the rebellion of the exploited proletarians,peoples, nations and countries oppressed by the monopolies and imperialistcountries. And it is up to the International Communist Movement to bring themthe revolutionary conscience, organize and transform the rebellions into arevolutionary struggle against the common enemy: the world capitalist systemof oppression and exploitation.</p>
<p>Com. Mao says that: 'World war may break out and revolutions may occur as aconsequence, or, revolutions may breakout everywhere and while confining itsstrength to with stand them, it may become impossible for imperialism toundertake another world war, whichever way it occurs this is as era ofrevolution'.</p>
<p>It is up to the communists to give an example of internationalist unity andstruggle against the preparations for a new imperialist world carnage; joinand coordinate efforts to promote the revolutionary struggle of theproletarian armies in all countries against the mobilization of troops andweapons for reactionary wars; construct a common front with all therevolutionaries, the anti-imperialist, democratic and environmentalist forcesthat oppose the war and the support and military commitment of the lackeyregimes with their imperialist masters across the world especially in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries; reject and denounce as traitors theopportunist satraps who, in the name of the proletariat and the peoples, givesupport to one of the imperialist factions, when they are all deadly enemiesof the oppressed and exploited of the world; relentlessly support therevolutionary struggle led by genuine Marxist-Leninist-Maoist communists,mainly the people's war in India together with other people's wars inPhilippines,Turkey,Peru, today are the vanguard of the World ProletarianRevolution, against imperialism and its reactionary national watchdogs.</p>
<p>Imperialist capitalism is in crisis! Long live Socialism and Communism!</p>
<p>Or the revolution stops the war or the war unleashes the revolution!</p>
<p>Workers and peoples of the world, unite against imperialism!</p>
