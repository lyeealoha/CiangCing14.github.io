<p>Following a serious incident members of Anti Imperialist Action Munster werecontacted by concerned parents and residents within a small community, whowere extremely worried about ongoing anti-social behaviour and drug dealing inthe area.</p>
<p>Our members listened to the concerns, and fears expressed and this communityfelt that as the issues raised were not against property of the State ordevelopers including rack rent landlords, that the forces of the State wereignoring their appeals for help, especially around the issue of drug dealing.</p>
<p>The attitude that drug dealing is everywhere and a fact of life in ghettoisedcommunities and that the under resourced services just can’t cope are apathetic attempt at excusing the lack of care the State and its organs havefor the working class and their communities.</p>
<p>We believe that the ongoing epidemic of substance misuse in our communities isa direct result of the lack of a wide variety of services for communities andfamilies suffering it’s ill effects, the second strand to the ongoing abilityof “low level” drug dealing is the mindset by the State that they are anintrinsic part of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the State, caughtwith “small” amounts these dealers are released back into the community andallow to continue death dealing if they will supply information on otherswithin their dealers network and or others within the community with whom theState has issues, political and social activists being the main targets ofsuch low intensity operations.</p>
<p>Our members acted upon the information of the community and removed a quantityof prescription medication hidden in an area around a children’s playground,these were subsequently disposed of using a medically approved system for themedications and items were likely to be of an extreme risk to health and life.</p>
<p>These prescription medications can be life threatening if a child ingeststhem, they are also a risk if mixed with other substances.  Quetiapine Increased risk of death due to dementia-related psychosis.Increased risk of suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Venlafaxine is contraindicated if it causes worsening suicidal ideation,depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Caution is advisable in heart failurepatients, hyperthyroidism, and those with recent myocardial infarctions as itcan raise blood pressure and increase heart rate</p>
<p>Anti-Imperialist Action like other Irish Republican groups not only recognisethe threat that drug dealers pose to our communities but also the use of suchindividuals by the State.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Republicans will always stand with the Community!</p>
