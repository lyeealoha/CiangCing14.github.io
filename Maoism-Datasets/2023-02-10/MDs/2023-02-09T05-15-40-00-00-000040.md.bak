**Ramallah, February 9, 2023:** The Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine welcomed today, the decision of the Catalan city of Barcelona fortemporarily suspending its relations with Israel, due to its crimes in theoccupied territories of Palestine.

This position reflects the popular will to reject violent practices by theIsraeli forces against our people, the Marxist-Leninist formation stated in adispatch.

In a letter addressed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,Barcelona’s mayor Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of itsinstitutional relations with Israel “until the authorities put an end to thesystematic violation of human rights against the Palestinians.”

The move includes cutting the twinning of the Catalan city with Tel Aviv untilfurther notice. “Barcelona has become the first city council to suspend tieswith apartheid Tel Aviv in solidarity with the Palestinian people,” the groupwrote on its Twitter account.
