In a response to a call from residents, members of Anti Imperialist ActionTallaght held an Anti Social Behaviour patrol in the Mac Uilliam estate Dublin24.

The purpose of the patrol was to engage with the small number of youth in thearea who are engaging in anti community behaviour, that has some residentsafraid in their own homes.

Working class estates like Mac Uilliam have been abandoned by the Free Stateand neglected for years. But there is a strong community spirit and throughthe patrols we will encourage the youth to engage in more positive behaviourand not to be intimidating residents in their own community.

Republicans will always respond to residents and communities who ask for ourassistance. Republicanism is the Revolutionary movement in this countrybecause it is of the community and rooted in working class areas across 32Countries.
