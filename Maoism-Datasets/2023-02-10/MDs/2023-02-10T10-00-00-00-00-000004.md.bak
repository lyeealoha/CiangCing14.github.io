Note: The following document was sent in an email from the Editorial Board ofTribune of the People to one of the Support Committees. It is the closestthing we have to an 'official position' of the Dallas-Cult on the question ofgender and sex. Not only does it show their blanket erasure and hatred of non-binary people, but also reveals their general transphobia, homophobia andmisogyny. If it means anything, To be absolutely clear: I post this documenthere to denounce and repudiate it.

I have tried to avoid adding my own commentary in previous posts but had todraw attention to the following line with respect to the underlying misogyny:"for women who use 'non-binary they still suffer the social status of womanand for men they still are granted the social status of men in the man womancontradiction." In the author's mind (likely either Ed Dalton or DavidMartinez), men and women are categories that apply to all people in allsocieties (even societies existing before or after women's oppressionexisted). Yet the nature of woman is to 'suffer' while the nature of man is to'be granted'. In other words the attitude of these men is to say, "blessed areyou, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe who has not created me a woman." Ifthe 'suffering' and 'being granted' which constitutes men and women no longerexists (in a society which has abolished the oppression of women), what thenwould it mean for an individual to identify outside the gender binary? Whatwould it mean to be a man or a woman anyway? Either we fix abiological/anatomical definition of gender, or we root the gender binary insociety, in which case it is subject to transformation and even abolition. Theargument presented here (repeated throughout the cult organizations) is onlysuperficially dialectical: its main essence is to define sex/gender as animmutable biological category, with one side being devalued in favor of theother.

To the Comrades in [Support Committee]:

Greetings, in the interests of not touching on the matter lightly we want tobriefly examine the question of the non-binary phenomenon from an MLMstandpoint, and issue this short document to develop line struggle anddiscussion. This relates to the use of “they/them” pronouns used to refer toindividuals in report backs.

1. What is “non-binary” in reference to? We must start there. The binary refers to feminist theory of the “gender binary” which is reliant on the feminist definition of gender, which became popularized starting in the 1970's. Before this, the term gender was used interchangeably with biological sex. In linguistics and editing gender was used to describe sets of words with masculine and feminine implications, i.e. Spanish is a “gendered” language with some words being neutered i.e. “camarada” a neutral word which is used the same for men and women, and words like Latino or Latina etc being gendered. Postmodernism has a focus on discourse, and in fact seeks to change reality through the discursive and hence gives a lot of importance to this question, and took the linguistic use of gender to apply it broadly to sociology in ways that do not meet scientific standards (meaning from a Marxist view this analysis is not linked to production or the oppression of women rooted in private property). So now gender means a set of social traits associated with capitalist ideas of men and women, and it is used to imply that men and women are nothing but social traits. However social traits come and go, so this is not an accurate way to define it.  2. If the binary exists objectively then there is no voluntary opting out. Meaning that the society we live in has backward social standards assigned to the expected behavior and personality traits of men and women—we must not confirm these but challenge them as reactionary culture. In other words masculinity among women does not diminish them as women, and femininity among men does not make diminish their status as men. Finally, however an individual self- identifies does not necessarily affect the way society identifies them or the expectations of their social traits.  The mode of production throughout class society has shaped these socialstandards and what is expected behavior and traits of men and womenrespectively, and this adjusts in each class epoch in that the distinctionschange but there remains distinction. Production in class society has donethis for the purpose of division, and it has only made two social categories,with no need for a third one or one that is neither. In other words, masculineand feminine traits form a contradiction and contradiction cannot stay inequilibrium one is principle. For women who use “non-binary” they still sufferthe social status of woman and for men they still are granted the socialstatus of men in the man woman contradiction. A thing can turn into itsopposite, the material basis for trans people, but what it cannot do is turninto something else entirely. Mao expresses this law in On Contradiction.  Point one converges with point two and “gender” as it has been used since the70's becomes interchangeable with sex again in a reversal—this is to suggestthat sex is a “social construct” and hence the category of “non-men” emergeswhich of course includes men who simply “do not identify” with masculinity,however they do not experience women's oppression and so should not beunderstood as facing this. Postmodernism uses the non-men category to actuallydiminish attention on the specific oppression of working women withmetaphysics

3. In many cases people seeking to reject what they call the binary are actually in reality just non-socially conforming either in their thinking or presentation or communication (we know these things do not determine reality) and many are doing this on the basis of a positive rejection of backward social norms. Socialism already deals with this issue and better, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, where the distinction between the dress and social function of male and female Red Guards was mainly obliterated with shared duty, shared uniform, shared patterns of behavior and expression. This must be understood as a vital step in the formation of new socialist people, the new socialist man and the new socialist woman, unfettered by capitalist social customs, and the oppression of women due to private property has been mercilessly attacked, and the cultural institutions springing from it have also been attacked. These are not understood as non-binary, and masculine traits and feminine traits still exist but are heading in a non-distinctive direction due to the lack and withdrawal of the oppression of women, hence the women's struggle is critical and central here as part of the socialist and cultural revolutions.  4. There are men and women in pre-class history but women were not oppressed or assigned a deficient feminine nature. Postmodernism does not serve the interests of women, it simply suggests that if women do not follow the backward idea of exhibiting a deficient feminine nature they are less women or no longer women, and now they have made an option for this— they/them pronouns are increasingly acceptable to imperialist culture because of this. Our point as Maoists is to defend militancy of women, defend them as part of the class, and as fighters for this class. At the same time, we seek to transform men away from the vulgar socialization under capitalism. Women cannot be mobilized as a specific force for proletarian revolution without identifying their status as women, the non-binary line which allows self-identification to determine reality does just this, it tells women to stop being women when they stop identifying with the backward idea of what a woman is, this is sexism in disguise.  5. Non-binary is often a forced compromise for trans people. There is nothing wrong with transition and while trans people might not have experienced the socialization of the sex they have come to identify and present as due to the principal aspect of their internal contradiction this does not mean that they are not either socially identified as such, or living the life of such. They face a specific oppression from their male or female counterparts in the class, and so trans women do not face the oppression of women, they face the oppression of trans women, and trans men are not awarded the same social status as men, this is important to understand if we want to confront the kind of discrimination they face. By not understanding this postmodernism has determined that how they identify determines them as men or women and the only thing to worry about is stigma more precisely discourse. So then trans people are divided into concession or non concession, non-binary affects some trans people very negatively, they are insecure to take their place as men or women and fight their specific discrimination as trans and end up compromising.  6. Machinery that allows women to work the same as men does a lot to change the social conditions, but women remain in a secondary status, used for cheaper labor and to be worked harder (See C. Zetkin). This will not change through discourse but through the seizure of the means of production by the proletariat who have an interest in equal pay for equal work. Women in production sets the conditions for the emancipation of women through socialist revolution (see F. Engels and Marxism, Mariategui, and the Women’s Movement)  Postmodernism on the other hand, treats the “gender” question on the basis ofmere stigma and interpersonal description and holds that ones thinkingdetermines social conditions and not production, hence they resolve thewomen's question not through revolutionary violence and destruction of theeconomic base but through gradual reforms in the superstructure. Theirpositions lead to the conclusion that linguistic and discursive shifts on amass and popular scale will “liberate” women from men, which is a falsehood.In essence, if women communicate differently and communication with them ischanged their status as oppressed changes too. This is due to the idea rootedin Judith Butler's queer theory that the problem is not knowing one's options,and that “gender” is just communication. In essence, their view is that theoppression of women predates class society and is also rooted in language andhence language can liberate women. And often all the adherents of this type ofthought see the principal contradiction as an interpersonal contradictionbetween men and women. The contradiction between men and women exists, but itis a secondary contradiction and non-antagonistic one a result of thecontradiction between women and class society which is antagonistic. Women’sliberation is therefore an incorrect idea because it posits that they shouldbe liberated from male chauvinism and men generally, a male dominated society.They ignore women’s role in production and the real contradiction that causesmale chauvinism in the first place. In essence, all of queer theory which iswhere the whole framework for “non-binary” is rooted seeks to provide pacifistand counter-revolutionary solutions to the problems in the superstructure topreserve the power of the ruling class over the base.

7. We do not ban terms but we do struggle for unity on terminology. We separate things into bourgeois and proletariat ideology. Communism, according to Engels, is the doctrine of the liberation of the proletariat, so other doctrines are necessarily to preserve the domination of the proletariat. We ascribe to communism.  The gender neutrality is important to some workers and many more pettybourgeois in the same way a religion is, we take the same approach. Eventhough we view it as metaphysics, we do not intend to be abrasive andconfrontational with this. If a worker is a Catholic or a Muslim, we do notinsist they give up on their religion to work with us, but we consistentlystruggle for materialism and we do not publish metaphysical analysis aboutpossession or the work of the devil even if this is used to denounce realhuman suffering. Our paper has the duty to correspond only to materialism andthe doctrine of the liberation of the proletariat.  In report backs, it is important to us to understand the actual materialexistence of our comrades, their place in society and what they experiencebecause we have to guide their practical activity. For instance, a trans womancomrade who is newly transitioning will still face a lot of specific prejudiceand so we should know this person’s status so that we do not insist they carryout work that might be dangerous to them. The same goes for if a comrade isBlack, or white and might be suited for a certain assignment, identity is nottotally unimportant. If we want undercover reports inside of a reactionary orfascist event, we send white men to do this because they blend in, sending atrans black woman would be harmful to the result and potentially harmful tothe comrade too. It also helps us understand what individuals face in theirdaily life and to be considerate of this.  Hence when individuals are described in reports as “they” or “them” it can beobscurantist and we who have not met these comrades cannot get a full or evenaccurate grasp of them or their experience and their lives. So we discourageusing obscurantism in reports, even if we respect the choices of thesecomrades and their own beliefs.  We are atheists and materialists, this is our philosophy and it informs ourpolitical line. We respect the beliefs of others and work with the exploitedand oppressed and those who face discrimination. Muslims face discriminationand we are absolutely against that because we oppose national chauvinism andreligious discrimination, and stand for religious freedom. However, we do notlegitimize these beliefs as reality. A socialist society would not banreligion for this reason, but it would practice atheism on a state level.  Mao says draw back the bow, but let the people fire the arrow. We take thesame view on the “gender” questions, we know that as long as there issuffering people will submit to religious salves, the opiates of the people,and we know that as long as there is the oppression of women, and backwardideas in society as a result, that there will be people who seek metaphysicalsalves for this. We do not harshly judge them or seek to exclude them justbecause they have not become full on materialists, most still actively standagainst oppression. When postmodernism becomes their guide to action, thisresults in counter-revolutionary action, it misleads the people and this mustbe fought, the same as Christian pacifism must be fought. Marxists cantolerate a worker’s religion, but cannot accept the idea that we must suffervirtuously and await god to solve our problems.

8. We stand for a society without rich or poor, where men and women exist in equality and there are no oppressive distinctions between them, where the people are free to express themselves in a new and proletarian manner. In short we uphold the slogan; make a casket for the old society! This means a new society won through revolutionary violence, through action. Even before getting there, we hope to act as new socialist women and new socialist men as much as we can and to break with old ideas, without succumbing to metaphysics as a painkiller, because metaphysics are not the truth and cannot bring about the liberation of our class.
