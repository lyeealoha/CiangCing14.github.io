### Stop the oppression of the community members of Buenos Aires, imbabura, out 
 with the mining companies, out with FFAA and the national police 

 Thousands of soldiers and police have released a bloody 
 oppression campaign against the community members of Buenos Aires, imbabura, as 
 contradicts mining in their area. 

 Despite the fact that society has on several occasions expressed resistance to 
 the presence of the mining companies in the country, especially the Australian 
 The subsidiary Hancine, releases these foreign companies, with consent 
 from Lasso's corrupt government and support from the armed forces and police, loose 
 persecution, imprisonment and oppression with firearms against the members of society 
 which resolutely opposes the suppression and the state's suppression apparatus. 

 Currently, the members of society report on injuries, disappearances and 
 Death. 

 El Frente De Defensa de las Lucha's del Pueblo del Ecuador is in solidarity 
 with the community members of Buenos Aires who brave fighting for the earth say and to 
 expel the invaders, in this case the mining companies, the armed forces and 
 the national police, who have become real occupation armies at 
 The land of poor farmers. 

 We condemn the armed forces and the national police as murderers and 
 oppressors; inept and cowardly to organized crime, brave and 
 furious against the unarmed population.

Inflation has risen dramatically in the runningest of the last year and this affects 
 Especially also people whose 'life and health depends on fixed expenses of medicine and 
 treatment every month. 

 Not only that the prices of medicine for various diseases, treatment and 
 rehabilitation in professional therapists increases, then the prices of one rise 
 Lots of other fixed expenses such as rent, heat, gas, food, transport and debt 
 for the masses, leaving even less money for the rising medicine. 

 This leads to more forced to directly opt out 
 medicine while sitting back in cold houses and apartments, with one 
 modest amount of food, to avoid total bankruptcy in the light of the crisis. 

 Many have fixed expenses on medicine and therapy of up to several thousand dollars 
 every month that they have to pay from their own pocket. This is a huge burden on 
 The masses in the country. Meanwhile, the bourgeoisie may where a thousand kroner to or from 
 Medicine expenses a month can't even be felt the system works well, 
 Because they can pay for the medicine without any problems, jump in front of the queue to 
 Treatment by using private hospitals and therapists. 

 But this characterizes an odd health system that repeatedly fails 
 Especially the deepest and widest masses in the country. 

 At the same time, the bourgeois state is repeatedly cutting down on the health care system, for 
 to create tax cuts for the bourgeoisie and to throw more money after 
 weapons and imperialist aggression. 

 At the same time we live in a country with some of the most advanced 
 Productive forces within the pharmaceutical industry, with tons of pills 
 produced every single day. At the same time, pharma companies hold like Novo Nordisk, 
 Artificial price of vital medicine high for the masses both in Denmark, but 
 Especially for the masses in the oppressed nations. 

 Life and Health-Nedic Medicine is a international right and expenses for it to 
 Don't pull the masses that need it down in misery. That 
 Imperialist bourgeoisi should not be allowed to take advantage of people being 
 willing to put their lives at risk to get advice for vital to 
 medicine, or die because they can't afford, for profit. 

 All this reveals the bourgeois health system, the bourgeois Danish state 
 And its role. It will not help the proletariat to demand »a nationalization 
 by Novo Nordisk «because the current old state is the yields. It's still 
 A yield state and state monopoly capital is still as parasitic and 
 yielding. 

 ![](Images/th-521056444.jpeg)Novo 
 Nordic, a Danish -owned imperialist company, holds, among other things. insulin which is 
 necessary for the treatment of diabetes, expensive for the masses in the oppressed 
 nations. 

 Our rights can only be won through battle, not by voting and hoping and 
 wait for change. No right that the working class has been achieved without a fight. 

 The fight for our rights must harden us and earn the reconstitution of DKP 
 Under Maoism and thus the introduction of the People's War for the Conquest of Power 
 in the country. Only then, by a socialist revolution through folk war and a new 
 Working State, a new health system that really serves the people can be created.

 A few steps forward in our country in terms of mobilizations on the plan 
 national, in units with the initiatives that are taking place at the level 
 international. 

 This step forward was undoubtedly the assembly of January 28 against the 
 war promoted by the port workers of GE's Calp, very participatory, with 
 Comrades from the South(Taranto), from Sardinia, from the center(Roma), from the 
 north(Pisa, Livorno, Firenze, Padova, Bergamo)The appeal of the port for one 
 national mobilization on February 25, one year after the beginning of the conflict 
 Imperialist war in Ukraine, led to a debate and decisions 
 on how to give continuity to the opposition to the war. One was decided 
 day of national struggle, in Genoa there will be an event with a procession 
 who will aim to enter the port, and that the mobilization will be supported by 
 proclamation of the strike in ports promoted by the USB and that, who cannot 
 Come to Genoa, will promote initiatives at the local level on this day. 

 For us, communist proletarians who participated and intervened in 
 Assembly, the initiative of the ports of the 25th puts the battle in the center 
 right and central who sees the protagonists of this mobilization 
 with the direct action to combat ships(così come è stato fatta negli
aeroporti come a Pisa)who transport direct weapons in the war areas and with 
 The strike that starts from the ports. This tool of struggle is an indication from 
 also follow for all trade union realities, in opposition to confederals that 
 are part of the conciliation front with the war choices of governments, 

 Yesterday Draghi and today Meloni. We have to work for this, the "strikes 
 general "of the basic unions have been absolutely isolated e 
 counterproductive, self -referential, who even led to the rift 
 of the procession of 3 December in Rome. 

 We think it is a useful fight tool to extend in the places of 
 I work the worker motion against the war which, as a Slai Cobas SC union, 
 It was signed by the workers of the Italian steelworks of Taranto, of the 
 Fincantieri of Palermo, from the Marcegaglia of Ravenna, of the Dalmine of Bergamo 
 and that we are spreading in other factories, which leads the workers to take sides 
 in the fight against the imperialists in war and, as regards the 
 Italian workers, the opposition to our government, to our imperialism. 

 The Assembly of the Ports of Genoa had as a positive data in addition to the 
 participation also the attention to our interventions that have from a 
 side brought the work, small but concrete, with the factories and the 
 Question of the bases in Taranto. 

 On the other, he clarified the political complaint towards the government, ours 
 imperialism and the character of the anti -imperialist war, which, due to 
 the composition of the room and the numerous interventions of the network area 
 Communists/USB/Cremaschi/Up/Rc/Pap, etc., had not been put at the center. These 
 forces hinder the anti -capitalist antimperialist class front and are a 
 damage for the same struggles as workers who say they represent 
 politically or directly directing, without the right line 
 of the indissolubility of the economic and political struggle. 
 At the same time we do not believe that movementism/expienzism serves 
 promoted by the GKN collective and the solidarity area of "converge to arise"(CPA-FI)where the worker direction of a class movement is watered. 

  

 A negative aspect was the lack of workers' realities starting from the former 
 Ilva. 
 At the end of the Assembly, a Calp worker, anti -fascist, who had been to 
 Bergamo also for FN, asked us for an opinion on how the assembly had gone, 
 This was an opportunity to share the need to involve the 
 also workers of the other factories, for example those of Ilva where they have 
 contacts, and the useful tool of the worker motion to discuss on 
 reasons of the imperialist Inter war and the proletarian opposition. 

 The assembly of 28 in Genoa also had the merit of carrying out the 
 construction of the unit of the opposition movement to war, come on 
 workers to students, from antimperialists to antimilitarists to 
 pacifists. 

 The appeal of the Calp, also with an analysis of the government that remains on the surface, 
 has put the need for mobilization against the war on the plan at the center 
 national: how do you boycott war from the territories when those who send the 
 Is weapons the Italian government and the imperialist state? 
 While the antimilitarist reduction with the password "we boycott the
our imperialism and our government, at the service of the bourgeoisie 
 Italian imperialist. It is not just about economic effects on the masses but 
 of reactionary political effects towards the formation of a regime: the 
 Fascism brings war, war brings fascism. We must strengthen the struggle 
 policy against our imperialism, for the defeat of ours 
 imperialism., seeing the step forward of the Meloni government and the modern 
 fascism. 

 It is therefore necessary to think from a proletarian and class point of view for 
 mobilize the factories to truly create a force to make war of 
 class. 

 The pacifist and antimilitarist positions have always had the limit 
 not to see the link with the armed struggles directed by the Maoist communists, with 
 The popular revolts, which are the substance of proletarian internamentalism. 

 We will bring this struggle within the proletarian assembly 
 national anti -capitalist who is held on February 18 in Rome to enhance it, 
 For a step forward in the formation of a united front against government, 
 masters, imperialist war.

### 

  ** Criticism of the Arab readers, the Arabic translation, for the opening of the first number of the magazine 
 The new global of the Mawlid Leninist Marxist movement, which has the title of conflict 
 Between the linear. ** 

### ** A breakthrough ** 

    We offer comrades in the parties and organizations of the UN -Leninist Communist Movement, 
 For the revolutionaries of all countries, global proletariat and the peoples of the world, the first issue of the magazine 
 The conflict between the two lines. 

    This is not a party magazine, no bloc, no faction or a certain direction within the Marxists 
 The Mawwin Leninists, but rather the decision of various parties and organizations to reinforce 
 The conflict between the two lines between the Communists, as its title and slogan indicates, and contributing to 
 Their unity, especially with the preparation of the Marxist Leninist seminar, Maoism 
 Unified. 

    The need for a magazine, such as the conflict between the two lines, lies in the urgency of the Communist movement 
 World to face the challenges imposed by the global situation, given the severity of contradictions 
 The most important of the capitalist imperialism: the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, 
 The contradiction between the imperialist states, peoples, and oppressed nations, and the contradiction between states 
 Various imperial monopolies. 

    These contradictions bring with it the escalation of the global revolution, which is evident in uprisings 
 Popular masses in the world, aggression against oppressed countries and resistance wars, 
 And the increasing preparations for a global war for a new division of the world, and to all of this 
 The scandalous destruction of nature ... these facts confirm the state of advanced imperialism 
 The capitalism and the excellent circumstances of the progress of the revolution, which requires the Communists to unite 
 Their efforts to form a global center to lead the revolution and progress in building the working class party in 
 Each country, which is necessary to ensure the victory of the global proletarian revolution. 

    A magazine like the line of conflict between the linear 
 An appropriate manner among the Marxist Leninist Communists Mawwin: Hajjaji controversy searches for 
 The truth is in actions, rejection of the logic of the factions, previously formed blocks, and conspiracies 
 Political maneuvers, and defection situations; and work to unite to implement the program 
 The subscriber to call for a unified global symposium for a new international organization for the proletariat. 

    For this reason, the two lines will publish documents from various parties and organizations on issues 
 Ideology, politics and organizationalism related to preparing for the unified global symposium 
 For the Mawwin Leninist Marxists. 

    Since all of our battle is against imperialism, and against the distortion of Brachnda, Evakyan and all 
 Various varieties, it is our duty to develop a general conflict of opinions, based on identity 
 The ideology of Marxism, Leninism, to clarify the differences within Marxism 
 The Maoism Leninism. At the same time, we need to spread an ideological and an ideological struggle about 
 The methods and effects created by the split sectarian positions in this conflict, 
 By clarifying the class character of the aforementioned positions, until the global communist movement reaches 
 Supreme level, unit level. 

    The magazine of the conflict between the two lines will also publish joint global advertisements that collect attitudes 
 And the common tasks that are part of the process of struggle for ideological unity 
 The political and organizational of the Communists in various countries. In the same way, reports will be published 
 And special calls to introduce the common struggles of global proletariat and the most important struggles 
 The proletariat and the peoples of the world against imperialism and reactionary. 

 The magazine of the conflict between the two lines will also include some historical documents of the Communist movement 
 The global that will be adopted as a guide and inspiring to solve the major issues facing our movement. 

    We invite the Marxist Leninist factions in various countries to consider these 
 The magazine belongs to it, to use it as a tool for the struggle for unity, because every party and organized 
 Marxian Leninism, Maui, according to her level, can and must make a major contribution 
 In achieving the Marxist Leninist seminar, the unified global Muawiyah. 

    Finally, the "conflict between the sin" does not replace the various efforts being made, 
 These efforts should continue by various parties and organizations to hold meetings 
 Bilateral and multi -party conferences and seminars ... necessary to do joint and assistance 
 They are mutual mutual to solve problems in order to achieve the major step of the Marxist symposium 
 The unified global Leninism claimed by the proletariat

# On the 80th anniversary of the victory in the battle of Stalingrad

The International Communist League correctly stated in its ‘Political
Declaration and the Principles of the International Communist League’: _“_ _We
assume the position of Chairman Mao on the role of comrade Stalin that he was
a great_ _Marxist._ _Furthermore,_ _we must bear_ _in mind_ _that_ _he was the
one who brilliantly defined_ _Leninism._ _We, the communists, today have the
task to_ _assume the defense of_ _his_ _role in_ _World War_ _II_ _within the
Communist International, particularly its 7_ _th_ ___World_ _Congress.”_ The
latter will be central for this article celebrating the tremendous victory in
the battle of Stalingrad.

The weight and significance of this great and heroic battle was correctly
established by Chairman Mao Tse-Tung: **“** **This battle is not only the
turning point of the Soviet-German war, or even of the present anti-fascist
world war, it is the turning point in the history of all mankind.”**

The war fought by the USSR, as it was absolutely correctly defined, was a
Great Patriotic War, a just war of defence. Additionally to the glorious and
heroic defence, in which the USSR under the leadership of Comrade Stalin had
to apply scorched land to defend its territory, to defend the socialist
motherland, what costed more than 25 million lives, the anti-imperialist
struggle unfolded vastly in the oppressed nations during this period.

Chairman Mao Tse-Tung just and correct thought us: **“The Soviet Union’s
sacred war of resistance against fascist aggression is being waged not only in
its own defence but in defence of all the nations struggling to liberate
themselves from fascist enslavement. For Communists throughout the world the
task now is to mobilize the people of all countries and organize an
international united front to fight fascism and defend the Soviet Union,
defend China, and defend the freedom and independence of all nations.”**

The peoples of the world rose for the just cause and spilled their precious
blood not only in the war against the axis, but also against their respective
imperialist masters, what initiated the great anti-colonial struggle in the
second half of the 20th century.

In the winter 1941/42 the Soviet Union under the leadership and command of
Comrade Stalin had already successfully rebuffed a vicious Nazi-German attack
on the western part of the country, aiming to take the capital Moscow. The
Nazi-Wehrmacht, not able to understand that every attempt to crush the
Bolshevist steel tempered by the great Lenin and Stalin was doomed to fail,
mounted an offensive on southern Russia in the summer of 1942. They set their
sights on Stalingrad, because the city served as an industrial center in
Russia, producing, among other important goods, artillery for the country’s
troops. The Volga River, which runs through the city, was also an important
shipping route connecting the western part of the country with its distant
eastern regions. The Nazis wanted the Wehrmacht to occupy Stalingrad, seeing
its value for propaganda purposes, given that it bore Stalin’s name. For
similar moral reasons there was a special need to defend it. The 6th Army of
the Wehrmacht began their assault on 23 August 1942.

Comrade Stalin, as the highest command, issued personally the Order 227, at
the end of July 1942, in order to elevate the level of sacrifices and fighting
spirit of the armed forces to the level of the people:

“ **The enemy throws new forces to the front without regard to heavy losses
and penetrates deep into the Soviet Union, seizing new regions, destroying our
cities and villages, and violating, plundering and killing the Soviet
population. Combat goes on in region Voronej, near Don, in the south, and at
the gates of the Northern Caucasus. The German invaders penetrate toward
Stalingrad, to Volga and want at any cost to trap Kuban and the Northern
Caucasus, with their oil and grain. […] Part of the troops of the Southern
front, following the panic-mongers, have left Rostov and Novochercassk without
severe resistance and without orders from Moscow, covering their banners with
shame.**

**The population of our country, who love and respect the Red Army, start to
be discouraged in her, and lose faith in the Red Army, and many curse the Red
Army for leaving our people under the yoke of the German oppressors, and
itself running east. Some stupid people at the front calm themselves with talk
that we can retreat further to the east, as we have a lot of territory, a lot
of ground, a lot of population and that there will always be much bread for
us. They want to justify the infamous behavior at the front. But such talk is
falsehood, helpful only to our enemies.**

**Each commander, Red Army soldier and political commissar should understand
that our means are not limitless. The territory of the Soviet state is not a
wives, brothers, children. The territory of the USSR which the enemy has
captured and aims to capture is bread and other products for the army, metal
and fuel for industry, factories, plants supplying the army with arms and
ammunition, railroads. After the loss of Ukraine, Belorussia, Baltic
republics, Donetzk, and other areas we have much less territory, much less
people, bread, metal, plants and factories. We have lost more than 70 million
people, more than 800 million pounds of bread annually and more than 10
million tons of metal annually. […] To retreat further - means to waste
ourselves and to waste at the same time our Motherland. Therefore it is
necessary to eliminate talk that we have the capability endlessly to retreat,
that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that
there is a large population, and that bread always will be abundant. Such talk
is false and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, if we do not
stop retreating we will be without bread, without fuel, without metal, without
raw material, without factories and plants, without railroads. This leads to
the conclusion, it is time to finish retreating. _Not one step back!_ […] It
is impossible to tolerate commanders and commissars permitting units to leave
their positions. It is impossible to tolerate commanders and commissars who
admit that some panic-mongers determined the situation on the field of combat
and carried away in departure other soldiers and opened the front to the
enemy. The panic-mongers and cowards should be exterminated in place.**

**Henceforth the solid law of discipline for each commander, Red Army soldier,
and commissar should be the requirement - not a single step back without order
from higher command. Company, battalion, regiment and division - commanders
and appropriate commissars, who retreat without orders from higher commanders,
are betrayers of the Motherland. These are the orders of our Motherland. To
execute this order - means to defend our lands, to save the Motherland, to
exterminate and to conquer the hated enemy.”**

Our heroic red soldiers were initially able to slow the Wehrmacht’s advances
during a series of skirmishes north of Stalingrad, offering more than 200,000
lifes, and successfully held off the Nazi hordes. It was decided not to flee
but withstand and therefore not to evacuate the more than 400,000 inhabitants
of the city. The men and women, even the youngest, of Stalingrad were
incorporated into war related activities – combat, construction, espionage,
supply, etc. Even when the walls of Stalingrad bursted by the Luftwaffe’s
constant bombardments or the heavy artillery strikes, the people stood
steadfast.

The Operation Uranus led by Georgy Zhukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky organized
Russian troops in the mountains to the north and west of the city. From there,
they launched a counterattack. Paying the necessary price the Red Army was
able to encircle the city by late November 1942, trapping the nearly 300,000
German and Axis troops(mainly Italian and Romanian), choking off the enemy
forces from vital supplies and essentially surrounding them in an ever-
tightening noose.

Close to Stalingrad the Red Army won important battles, including in Rostov-
on-Don, about 250 miles away from Stalingrad. Thus the enemy forces were
thinned and stretched at that part of the front and the Operation Little
Saturn in the west of Stalingrad was successful. With men, not arms, proving
the Marxist principle about what is most important correct once again, they
strangled the invaders to death and fought the greatest battle of war in
cities ever seen. It was a war not only from street to street, nor from house
to house or cellar to cellar, not even floor by floor, but room by room,
generating the most heroism, chapters that have shaken the world.

On the significance of the battle of Stalingrad for the whole course of the
war Chairman Mao stated: **“…in this present war the attack on Stalingrad is
the expression of the last desperate struggle of fascism itself. At this
turning point in history, too, many people in the world anti-fascist front
have been deluded by the ferocious appearance of fascism and have failed to
discern its essence. For forty-eight days there raged an unprecedentedly
bitter battle, unparalleled in the history of mankind–from August 23, when the
entire German force crossed the bend of the River Don and began the all-out
attack on Stalingrad, through September 15, when some German units broke into
the industrial district in the northwestern section of the city, and right up
to October 9, when the Soviet Information Bureau announced that the Red Army
had breached the German line of encirclement in that district. Ultimately this
battle was won by the Soviet forces. During those forty-eight days, the news
of each setback or triumph from that city gripped the hearts of countless
millions of people, now bringing them anxiety, now stirring them to elation.**
of the present antifascist world war, it is the turning point in the history
of all mankind.** **Throughout these forty-eight days, the people of the world
watched Stalingrad with even greater concern than they watched Moscow last
October.** **[** **…** **]** **following the battle for the defence of
Stalingrad, the situation will be totally different from that of last year. On
the one hand, the Soviet Union will launch a second winter counteroffensive on
a vast scale, Britain and the United States will no longer be able to delay
the opening of the second front(though the exact date cannot yet be
foretold), and the people of Europe will be ready to rise up in response. On
the other hand, Germany and her European accomplices no longer have the
strength to mount large-scale offensives, and Hitler will have no alternative
but to change his whole line of policy to the strategic defensive.”**

We all know, and we must remember, that the fascist offensive led by the
Nazis, to which the Italian and Spanish fascists as well as others like the
Romanians, Hungarians and also Bandera’s bunch of rats from Ukraine
contributed, and which used all the economic might of subjugated Europe, threw
millions over millions, the cream of the German army, 75% of its air force,
into the invasion. But comrade Stalin had wisely handled diplomacy with great
subtlety.

It is worth noting the sagacity and penetration of the Soviet intelligence
service. What an intelligence service. They knew the exact day of the Nazi-
invasion.

The Soviet Union applied a strategic defence together with scorched earth,
leaving them nothing but bare earth, mud, ashes and the most brave, determined
and resolute partisans behind the enemies lines. They had the audacity, the
courage to blow up monumental works such as the famous dam that links the
Volga with the Don that took so many years of effort. The Germans never
dreamed, they thought that this work would not be blown up, because it was too
important and had cost a lot.

The dictatorship of the proletariat was at stake, the revolution was at stake,
we cannot stop to think, nor can we simply allow ourselves to be hindered, as
Chairman Mao said, by the defence of inches of land. They crashed at the gates
of Leningrad, at the gates of Moscow and Stalingrad; but not only

scorched earth was carried out, but guerrillas and even simple individual men
and women with their rifles, their ammo and their vodka awaited the enemy. To
annihilate one of those brave heroes and heroines, the Germans lost 10 men,
averagely.

The fascist offensive was a military plan of very high quality, thus, the
highest and most enlightened German military leaders elaborated this plan and
the German school has a many times proven war tradition: in three months they
planned to conquer the USSR.

Comrade Stalin’s foresight, he had already taken measures since the 1930s when
there was the great transformation of the countryside and industry, they had
already transferred factories beyond the Urals, even foreseeing the
possibility of leaving as far as Moscow, for it is true, everything was

already in place in case they could not ultimately defend Moscow, even if that
was the decision taken, it was already planned to move the leadership and the
centre to the Urals; So the first thing that was done was to make arrangements
for Lenin’s transfer, because he could not fall into the dirty hands of the
wretched sons of hell, he could not fall.

But the order, after they had penetrated to the above mentioned gates, the
order was not to retreat any further!It is very memorable, and we must always
remember how on November 7, the anniversary of the revolution, they had
nowhere to celebrate it and it was considered impossible to carry it out;
comrade Stalin said: “to the station”, “but there is no platform there, there
are no seats there”, comrade Stalin stepped on a box and spoke in celebration
of the revolution, saying: “how many of us were there when we seized power,
what forces did we have when we repulsed the imperialist aggression
immediately after the October Revolution? We will crush them, and we will
annihilate the beast in its own den, in Berlin.”

These are things one must remember, to appreciate comrade Stalin one must look
at the Second World War. We all know how then came the great resistance, the
breaking of the German lines, the siege of Stalingrad where the German
commanders, Hitler himself, commanded them not to retreat to those inferior
subhumans. Those inferiors, the barbarians, the Mongols, hunted them down like
rats and they had to surrender.

It is always good to reiterate this: Stalin, the skillful and wise manager of
war, always took the moral element into account and paraded all the defeated,
surrendered Nazis and threw their flags, their eagles, their swastikas at the
foot of Lenin’s mausoleum; not only a great military defeat, but a

great moral defeat!The Nazi arrogance had been sunk in the mud and trampled
beginning of the breakdown of the Nazi Wehrmacht.

In February 1943 Comrade Stalin analysed: **“Three months ago the troops of
the Red Army began their offensive at the approaches to Stalingrad. Since then
the initiative in military operations has remained in our hands and the pace
and striking power of the offensive operations of the Red Army have not
weakened. Today, in hard winter conditions, the Red Army is advancing over a
front of 1,500 kilometres(950 miles)and is achieving successes practically
everywhere. In the north, near Leningrad, on the central front, at the
approaches to Kharkov, in the Donets Basin, at Rostov, on the shores of the
Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, the Red Army is striking blow after blow at the
Hitlerite troops. In three months the Red Army has liberated from the enemy
the territory of the Voronezh and Stalingrad regions, the Checheno-Ingush,
North Ossetian, Kabardino- Balkarian and Kalmyk Autonomous Republics, the
Stavropol and Krasnodar Territories, the Cherkess(Circassian), Karachaisu and
Adygeisu Autonomous Regions and almost the whole of the Rostov, Kharkov and
Kursk Regions.**

**[…] in the winter of 1942-43 alone, the Germans lost over 7,000 tanks, 4,000
planes, 17,000 guns […] since the beginning of the war, has put out of action
about 9,000,000 German-fascist officers and men, of whom no less than
4,000,000 were killed on the battlefield.**

**[…] first, the weakness of the German army is the shortage of man-power
reserves, and consequently it is not known from what sources these losses will
be replaced. […] the Red Army has become a seasoned army. […] millions of Red
Army men have become masters of their weapons [ …]**

**It cannot be considered an accident that the Red Army Command not only
liberates Soviet soil from the enemy but does not let the enemy leave our soil
alive, carrying out such important operations as the encirclement and
annihilation of enemy armies which can well serve as examples of military art.
This is undoubtedly a sign of the maturity of our commanders.**

**There can be no doubt that only the correct strategy of the Red Army
Command, and the flexible tactics of our commanders who execute it, could have
resulted in such an outstanding fact as the encirclement and annihilation at
Stalingrad of an enormous picked army of Germans, numbering 330,000 men.”**

Our Brazilian comrades pointed out: The victory against fascism in the Second
World War is one of the great historical events of the process of the
Proletarian World Revolution, the imperialist camp found itself deeply beaten,
three important imperialist powers were defeated - Germany, Japan and Italy -
which has to be seriously studied for its just and correct comprehension, it
has to be highlighted and celebrated.

The Communist Party of China affirmed, regarding the evaluation of this
historic experience:

“ **In the first place, the history of anti-fascist war shows that the
socialist system has an enormous vitality that can resist the most severe test
and that a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat is invincible.**

**In second place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that imperialism
is the source of all wars in modern times, that the aggressive nature of
imperialism will not change and because of that, to defend world peace it is
necessary to persist in the struggle against imperialism.**

**In third place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that the peoples
war sure to attain victory, that it is completely possible to defeat the
imperialist aggressors, that imperialism is a paper tiger, who is apparently
strong, but in reality is weak, and that the atomic bomb is also a paper
tigress and it is the people and not the arms, of any class, who decide the
outcome of the war.**

**In fourth place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that, in order to
defeat the imperialist aggressor, it is imperative to trust in the unity of
the revolutionary forces of the people in all countries, to attract to our
side all the forces that can be won, to form the broadest possible
international united front and concentrate our blows on the main enemy of the
peoples of the world.”**

Under the guns of the glorious Red Army Nazi-Germany was shattered, Socialism
and the dictatorship of the proletariat arose in up to Eastern Germany. The
Red Banner of the Communist Party and the USSR waving over the shadowed and
destroyed German Reichstag is an undeniable great moment of the international
proletariat that symbolize the whole heroic and glorious epic of the struggle
against fascism in defense of the USSR and for the development of the
Proletarian World Revolution. The sentence made by comrade Dimitrov when he
embarked in the direction of

USSR after the great victory in the Nazi Tribunal in Leipzig was thus
accomplished: _“We will make Germany Soviet!”._

 Intelligence and ordered them to eliminate the Maoists, both those who have 
 Weapons like those who have pen. For a few years, the forces 
 Hindutva have introduced a new expression in India: Urban Naxal. Now him 
 Prime Minister has once again used the same phrase, but in his own style 
 of satirical speech, Kalamdhari(poseedor de bolígrafos). Therefore, this 
 indicates that the Prime Minister and Interior Minister of India are very 
 eager to eliminate the Indian revolutionary movement to fulfill their 
 Make in India dreams. 

 On December 11, the Indian Interior Minister held a crucial meeting 
 high -level with Indian intelligence officers in New Delhi and clarified his 
 Plan at that meeting. Said police forces are ready to enter 
 In the Maad area of the Narayanpur district, Chhattisgad to take it under 
 Your control. 

 On January 7, the same Indian Minister of Interior, Amit Sha, went to 
 A public meeting in Korba, an industrial center of the state of Chhattisgad. 
 At that meeting he declared that his government will create an Indian free of Maoist 
 before the general elections of 2024. Meanwhile, they were carried out 
 several meetings at the local level with police officers for a better 
 Coordination of state and central forces in the next operations 
 military 

 Finally, their maoist eradication operations began in forests 
 border from the districts of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada, which is the area 
 adjacent to the state of Telangana. In this great operation, the 
 NSG(National Security Guards), Gray Hounds, Cobra and other armed forces of 
 The Central Police, together with the Garuda Commands of the Indian Air Force. 
 But the PLGA guerrillas retaliated with the full support of the 
 local revolutionary town. 

 Indian ruling classes and their central and state governments are 
 They hurried to eliminate the Indian revolutionary movement. Because it's him 
 main obstacle in its looting and plundering of the country's rich resources. 
 On the other hand, the indigenous peoples of India are fighting for their fair 
 claims. They fight for their legal rights over their forests. They are in
reactionaries of the center and the State, who work for the benefit of 
 great corporations, are launching new and greater forms of attack against 
 the village. Therefore, our CC [Central Committee] makes a new call 
 so that you condemn these attacks and raise your voices against the forces 
 Hindutva fascists. 

 In our country, democratic and revolutionary intellectuals, 
 patriots, rights activists, students, young people, 
 secularists, writers, artists, lawyers, defenders of 
 indigenous peoples, the anti -imperialist forces that love peace and 
 Ecologists firmly oppose corporatization, militarization of 
 forests and, in particular, to the country's Hinduization. Therefore, it is the 
 most favorable moment to develop and consolidate the movement of 
 Indian revolutionary solidarity in support of the Popular War throughout the 
 world.

# ** about the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Stalingrad ** 

 International Communist Association said correctly in its' political statement 
 and International Communist Association's Principles': »_VI occupies President 
 Mao's position on Comrade Stalin's role that he was a great Marxist. Moreover 
 Should we remember that it was him who defined Leninism brilliantly. 
 We, the Communists, today have the task of assuming the defense of his role in 
 World War II within the Communist International, especially its 7. 
 World Congress. ”_ The latter will be central to this article that celebrates 
 The huge victory in the Battle of Stalingrad. 

 The weight and meaning of this great and heroic battle was properly established 
 by President Mao TSetung: »** This blow is not only the turning point in it 
 Soviet-German war or even in the present anti-fascist world war, 
 That's the turning point in the whole story of mankind. ** ** «** 

 The war that the Soviet Union fought was, as it was quite correct 
 Defined, a great Fatherland War War, a just defense war. Besides the 
 glorious and heroic defense where the Soviet Union under the leadership of mate 
 Stalin had to apply burnt country to defend its territory, in order to 
 defend the socialist fatherland, which cost more than 25 million 
 life, the anti -imperialist struggle developed violently in the oppressed 
 nations during this period. 

 Chairman Mao TSetung thought to us fairly and correctly: ** »** ** the Soviet Union's 
 Holy Resistance War against the Fascist Aggression not only led to 
 Defense of the Soviet Union, but in defense of all the nations fighting 
 To free yourself from fascist slavery. For communists in the whole world is 
 the task now to mobilize people in all countries and organize an international 
 unit front to fight fascism and defend the Soviet Union, defend China 
 and defend the freedom and independence of all nations. ** ** «** 

 The World's People rose up for the righteous case and shed their precious 
 blood not only in the war against the axis but also against their respective 
 imperialist gentlemen, which initiated the great anti -colonial fight in the second 
 half of the 20th century. 

 In the winter of 1941/42, the Soviet Union had under the leadership and command of mate 
 Stalin already successfully rejected a malicious Nazi-German attack on it 
 Western part of the country with a view to taking the capital Moscow. The 
 Nazi Armed Forces that could not understand that any attempt to crush it 
 Bolshevik steel that was hardened by the great Lenin and Stalin was doomed to 
 to fail, began an offensive against southern Russia in the summer of 1942. They 
 put their sieve grain on Stalingrad because the city acted as an industrial 
 the center of Russia, which, among other things, produced important goods, including artillery 
 to the country's troops. The Volga River, which runs through the city, was also an important 
 Ship route that connected the western part of the country with the distant eastern 
 Regions. The Nazis wanted the armed forces to occupy Stalingrad as they 
 So its value in propaganda when it bore Stalin's name. Of similar moral 
 Reasons were a special need to defend it. The Arms of the Armed Forces 6th Army 
 began their attack on August 23, 1942. 

 Comrade Stalin issued personally, as the top command, at the end of 
 July 1942 order 227 to raise the sacrificed forces of the armed forces and fighting spirit 
 to the level of the people: 

 ** »The enemy throws new forces to the front without regard to great losses and penetrates 
 deep into the Soviet Union, occupying new areas, destroying our cities and 
 Villages and violates, looting and killing the Soviet population. the fight 
 continues in the region of Voronej, near Don, in the south and at the gates of the northern 
 Caucasus. The German attackers are entering towers towards Stalingrad, to Volga and wishes 
 at all costs to catch Kuban and the northern Caucasus with their oil and 
 cereal. […] Part of the troops on the southern front have followed the panic makers and abandoned 
 Rostov and Novochhercask without serious resistance and without the order of Moscow, as 
 they cover their tabs with shame. ** 

 ** The population of our country who loves and respects the Red Army begins 
 to become discouraged in her and lose faith in the Red Army, and many curses 
 The Red Army for having left our people under the yoke of the German oppressors 
 And even flee to the east. Some stupid people by the front soothe themselves 
 with talk that we can pull ourselves further to the east as we have a large area, 
 a lot of land, very population, and that there will always be a lot of bread for us. The 
 want to justify the notorious behavior at the front. But such a talk 
 is a lie that only helps our enemies. ** 

 ** Each commander, soldier in the Red Army and Political Commissioner should understand that
but people - workers, peasants, intelligentsia, our fathers, mothers, 
 Wives, brothers, children. The territory of the Soviet Union that the enemy has conquered and 
 intends to conquer, are bread and other products for the army, metal and 
 fuel for industry, factories, facilities that supply the army with weapons and 
 Ammunition, Railways. After the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic 
 Republics, Donetzk and other areas we have much less territory, many 
 Fewer people, bread, metal, factories and factories. We have lost more than 
 70 million people, more than £ 800 million broke a year and more than 
 10 million tons of metal a year. […] To withdraw further - 
 means that we are wasting ourselves and at the same time wasting our motherland. Therefore 
 it necessary to remove the talk of the fact that we have the ability to pull us 
 infinitely back that we have a large area that our country is large and 
 rich that there is a large population and that there will always be plenty of 
 Bread. Such a talk is fake and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, 
 If we don't stop withdrawing we will be without bread, without 
 fuel, without metal, without raw materials, without factories and plants, without 
 Railways. This leads to the conclusion that it is time to stop 
 The withdrawal. Not a step back![…] It is impossible to tolerate that 
 Commissioners and Commissioners allow units to leave their positions. That 
 are impossible to tolerate commanders and commissioners who admit that some 
 Panic stockers determined the situation on the battlefield and led other soldiers with 
 Say in departure and opened the front of the enemy. Panic makers and cowards should 
 exterminated on site. ** 

 ** In the future, the fixed law of discipline for each commander, soldier in it should 
 Red Army and Commissioner be the claim - not a single step back without order 
 from the higher leadership. Company, Battalion, Regiment and 
 Division commanders and the relevant commissioners who withdraw 
 Without the order of higher command, are traitors of the motherland. This is ours 
 Motherland Orders. To execute this order - means to defend our country that 
 save the motherland, to eradicate and defeat the hated enemy. «** 

 Our heroic red soldiers were initially able to slow down 
 The protection of the armed forces during a series of matches north of Stalingrad, and sacrificed 
 More than 200,000 lives, and they successfully kept the Nazi hordes back. That 
 were decided not to escape but to keep up and therefore not to evacuate 
 the more than 400,000 inhabitants of the city. The men and the women, even the youngest, in 
 Stalingrad was involved in war -related activities - battle, construction, 
 espionage, supply, etc. Even when Stalingrad's walls jumped in the air because of 
 Luftwaffe's constant bombings or the heavy artillery attacks stood 
 the population firmly. 

 Operation Uranus under the direction of Georgy Zhukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky 
 Organized Russian troops in the mountains north and west of the city. From here 
 they initiated a counter -attack. By paying the necessary price was the Red Army in 
 stand to surround the city at the end of November 1942 and catch the nearly 
 300,000 German and axis troops(hovedsageligt italienske og rumænske), strangle they 
 hostile forces from vital supplies and essentially surround them 
 in a still tighter loop. 

 Near Stalingrad, the Red Army won important battles, including In Rostov-on- 
 Don, approx. 250 miles from Stalingrad. Thus the enemy forces were thinned 
 out and stretched out on that part of the front, and Operation Little Saturn West of 
 Stalingrad was a success. With men, not weapons, which once again proved, 
 that the Marxist principle of what is most important was correct, they tormented 
 the attackers to the death and fought the greatest war beats in cities that ever 
 is seen. It was a war not only from street to street, nor from house to 
 house or from basement to basement, not even from floor to floor, but from room 
 to spaces that produced the most heroic, chapters that have shaken the world. 

 About the meaning of the Battle of Stalingrad for the entire course of the war stated 
 Chairman Mao: ** »** **… In this current war is attacked on Stalingrad expression 
 For the last desperate struggle of fascism for fascism itself. Also on this 
 Turning point in the story are many people in the anti -fascist world front 
 been mislead by the fuscism's fucking appearance and has not understood its 
 creature. For 48 days, an unprecedented battle raged unparalleled in 
 The History of Man 
 crossed the arch of the Don River and initiated the total attack on Stalingrad, over it 
 September 15, when some German units broke into the industrial district of it 
 northwestern part of the city, and right up to October 9, when the Soviet 
 Information agency announced that the Red Army had broken the German 
 surrounding line in this neighborhood. In the end, this match was won by the 
 Soviet forces. During these 48 days the news grabbed about each one
the hearts of people, and now it brought them anxiety, now it aroused them 
 excitement. This blow is not only the turning point of the Soviet-German war 
 or even in the present anti -fascist world war, that is the turning point in 
 The whole history of humanity. During these 48 days the world's population has 
 followed Stalingrad with even greater concern than they followed Moscow in October 
 last year. […] After the Battle of the Defense of Stalingrad, the situation will be 
 Completely different from last year. On the one hand, the Soviet Union will launch one 
 Second Winter Modoffensive on a large scale, Britain and the United States will no longer 
 could delay the opening of the other front(selv om den nøjagtige dato endnu
ikke kan forudsiges), and the populations of Europe will be ready to rise 
 in response. On the other hand, Germany and its European accomplice do not 
 longer strength to launch large offensives and Hitler will not have 
 other choice than to change his entire policy to strategic defensive. ** ** «** 

 We all know and we must remember that the fascist offensive that was led by 
 the Nazis, and as the Italian and Spanish fascists as well as others who 
 The Romanians, the Hungarians and also Bandera's bunch of rats from Ukraine contributed to, and 
 which used the whole subdued Europe's financial strength threw millions 
 over millions, the cream of the German army, 75 % of its air force, into 
 the invasion. But Comrade Stalin had wisely handled the diplomacy with great 
 finesse. 

 It is worth noting the sharpness of the Soviet intelligence services and 
 impact. What an intelligence service. They knew the exact day 
 for the Nazi invasion. 

 The Soviet Union used a strategic defense along with burnt land so they 
 not left other than bare land, mud, ash and the most brave, decisive 
 And resolutely partisans behind enemy lines. They had that audacity and the courage 
 To blow up monumental works such as the famous dam that connects 
 Volga and Don, who have demanded so many years of effort, in the air. The Germans dreamed 
 never if they thought this work would not be blown up in the air because 
 It was too important and had cost a lot. 

 The dictatorship of the proletariat was at stake, the revolution was at stake, we cannot 
 Stop up thinking, nor we can't just let us hinder as chairman 
 Mao said, of the defense of inches of land. They struck down at the gates to Leningrad, 
 at the gates of Moscow and Stalingrad; but not only burnt soil became 
 performed but guerrillas and even simple individual men and women with their 
 rifles, their ammunition and their vodka waited for the enemy. To 
 destroy one of these brave heroes and heroines lost the Germans in 
 average 10 men. 

 The fascist offensive was a military plan of very high quality, and therefore 
 drafted the highest and most enlightened German military leaders this plan, and the 
 German school has a many times proven war tradition: In three months planned 
 they to conquer the Soviet Union. 

 Comrade Stalin's foresight he had already taken measures 
 since the 1930s when a major transformation of the rural areas occurred and 
 the industry they had already moved factories in addition to Ural and even predicted 
 the opportunity to go so far as to Moscow, because it is true, everything was 
 already in place if they ultimately couldn't defend Moscow, although 
 It was the decision that was made it was already planned to move 
 Management and Center to Ural; Then the first thing that was done was to meet 
 Measures to Lenin's transfer, for he could not fall into the miserable 
 Hell -sons' dirty hands he couldn't fall. 

 But the order, after they were penetrated to the above ports, was the order that they 
 Didn't have to retreat further!It is very memorable and we have to 
 always remember how they on November 7, on the anniversary of the revolution, not 
 had any place to celebrate it and it was considered impossible to complete 
 the; Comrade Stalin said: 'But there is no platform there there are no seats 
 there «, Comrade Stalin stepped up on a box and spoke for celebration of 
 the revolution and said, “How many of us were there when we grabbed the power, which 
 forces we had when we beat the imperialist aggression back 
 Immediately after the October Revolution? We will crush them and we will 
 destroy the beast in its own cave, in Berlin. " 

 These are things to remember to understand mate stalin to look at 
 World War II. We all know how then the great resistance came, 
 How the German lines were broken, how the siege of Stalingrad came, 
 where the German commanders, Hitler themselves, ordered them not to withdraw 
 back for these inferior sub -humans. These sub -humans, the barbarians, 
 The Mongols, chased them like rats, and they had to surrender. 

 It's always good to repeat this: Stalin, the skilled and wise 
 war manager, always took into account the moral element and he let all of them 
 defeated, surrendered Nazis go into parade and threw their flags, their eagles and
Defeat, but also a great moral defeat!The Nazi arrogance was 
 been lowered in the mud and trampled down, it was the greatest moral blow, 
 it had ever gotten and that was the beginning of the Nazi 
 The collapse of the Armed Forces. 

 In February 1943, Comrade Stalin analyzed: ** »** ** three months ago 
 launched the Red Army troops their offensive by the approach roads to 
 Stalingrad. Since then, the initiative of the military operations has remained in 
 our hands, and the pace and impact in the offensive operations of the Red Army 
 has not been weakened. Today the Red Army is moving under tough winter conditions 
 over a front of 1,500 km and achieves practically everywhere successes. IN 
 north, near Leningrad, on the central front, at the entrance to Kharkov, in 
 Donets-Belket, by Rostov, by the Azov Sea and the Black Sea, beats the Red Army 
 blows after battle against Hitler's troops. Over the course of three months the Red Army has 
 liberated Voronezj and Stalingrad regions, they are Chechen-English, 
 North Ossetic, Kabardino-Balkarian and Kalmyca Autonomous Republics, 
 Stavropol and Krasnodar territories, the Chechen, Karatjaxian and 
 adygi-visuistic autonomous regions and almost all of Rostov-, Kharkov- and Kursk- 
 the region from the enemy. ** 

 ** […] In the winter of 1942-43 the Germans lost over 7,000 tanks, 4,000 
 aircraft, 17,000 guns […] Since the beginning of the war has set about 9,000,000 
 German-fascist officers and men out of the game, of which no less than 
 4,000,000 were killed on the battlefield. ** 

 ** […] First, the weakness of the German Army is the lack of manpower reserves, 
 And consequently, you do not know from which these losses will be replaced. […] the Red 
 Army has become a seasoned army. […] Millions of men in the Red Army have become 
 masters in their weapons […] ** 

 ** It cannot be regarded as a coincidence that the Red Army's command not 
 simply liberates Soviet soil from the enemy but do not let the enemy leave our 
 land alive as it implies such important operations as a surrounding and 
 the annihilation of hostile armies that may well serve as examples of 
 Military art. This is undoubtedly a sign of our commanders' maturity. ** 

 ** There can be no doubt that only the correct strategy from the Red Army 
 Command and the flexible tactics of our commanders who perform it, 
 could have resulted in such an excellent fact as the surrounding and 
 the destruction at Stalingrad of a huge collected army of Germans at 
 330,000 man. «** 

 Our Brazilian comrades pointed out: the victory over fascism in other 
 World War is one of the great historical events in the proletarian 
 World Revolution's process, the imperialist camp found itself deeply beaten, 
 Three important imperialist powers were defeated - Germany, Japan and Italy 
 - which is to be studied seriously to gain a fair and correct understanding, 
 It must be highlighted and celebrated. 

 China's Communist Party confirmed in terms of the evaluation of this 
 Historical experience: 

 ** »First, showing the story of the anti -fascist war that it 
 Socialist system has a huge vitality that can withstand the hardest 
 trial, and that a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat is invincible. ** 

 ** Secondly, the history of the anti -fascist war shows that imperialism is 
 the source of all wars of modern times that the aggressive nature of imperialism not 
 will change and that it is therefore necessary to continue the fight against 
 imperialism to defend world peace. ** 

 ** Third 
 sure to win that it is quite possible to defeat the imperialist 
 aggressors that imperialism is a paper tiger that is apparently strong, 
 but in reality is weak and that the nuclear bomb is also a paper tiger and that it 
 are the people and not the weapons, regardless of class that determines the outcome of the war. ** 

 ** For the fourth, showing the history of the anti -fascist war that it in order to 
 defeating the imperialist aggressor is imperative to trust the 
 the unity of revolutionary folk forces in all countries, to draw all the powers, 
 that can be won, to our side, to form the widest possible international 
 unit front and concentrate our battle against the world's main enemy. «** 

 During the glorious Red Army Cannons, Nazi-Germany was crushed, socialism 
 And the dictatorship of the proletariat emerged throughout East Germany. The Communist Party 
 and the Soviet Union's Red Banner Wing Over the Shadowed and Destroyed German 
 Reichstag, is an undeniable great moment for the international proletariat, 
 that symbolizes all the heroic and glorious epic of the fight against fascism 
 In defense of the Soviet Union and of the development of the proletarian 
 World Revolution. The phrase that mate Dimitrov stated when he went into 
 walk toward the USSR after the great victory in the Nazi tribunal in Leipzig, became 
 Thus completed: _ "We will do Germany Soviet!" _.

 On Sunday, January 29, 2023, by different media the 
 aggression of which the agricultural community of Rincón Tagolaba was subject(Rinconcito), located in Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. Armed subjects on board more 
 of 10 trucks arrived to the community with the clear intention of 
 intimidate the population in retaliation for the collective determination of 
 Defend natural resources such as trees and water. 

 The operation of armed men was headed by the Mercenarios brothers 
 Anastasio and Sergio Gutiérrez García, colloquially known as _ "tacho 
 Basket and Sergio Canalla "_, and identified by the government itself of the 
 Republic as leaders of the _ "poster of the dispossession" _ that operates in different 
 Municipalities of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. [one] 

 The background of violence against the community are evident: 

       I. On July 31, 2022 Sergio and his gunmen entered Rincón Tagolaba with the intention of imposing as his lieutenant a criminal named Luis López Zárate, who was rejected by the community assembly due to his background. On that occasion Sergio Gutiérrez García just threatened to threaten the community representatives ensuring that he would return. Of these facts there is a complaint with the Attorney General of the State of Oaxaca. 

      II. Subsequently, on January 17, 2023, the community arrested a truck with unknown subjects who were carving the mountain without permission from the inhabitants. The strangers did not identify, but pointed out that they had orders of Sergio Gutiérrez García to make more than 100 hectares of land. The strangers were expelled from the community without allowing them to take the wood.

 Talamontes deforested the community of Rincón Tagolaba 
  
  

 In retaliation on January 29, 2023 Tacho, Sergio and his group entered 
 armed, remaining in the community for more than five hours collapsing the 
 Posts and fences from the workshop land, destroying water hoses 
 drinkable and access chains to the community. During their stay they made 
 firearm shots and besieged the homes of the representatives 
 Community, mocking them and challenging them out of their homes. 

 From these facts, the Government Secretariat of the State of Oaxaca was notified, 
 The Attorney General of the State of Oaxaca, the Human Rights Ombudsman 
 of the people of Oaxaca and the national mechanism for the protection of people 
 Defenders and journalists, requesting their intervention to safeguard the 
 life and integrity of peasant families. 

 The National Guard arrived at the scene after a long time, and 
 Coincidentally the aggressors retired just a few minutes before, 
 taking all the necessary time to collect the bullet caps 
 percussed, but leaving the evidence of the damage and fires that 
 caused against the population.

 Today again the situation is of anxiety as Sergio Gutiérrez García assures 
 that will return to achieve its mission that is none other than impose on your 
 lieutenant, illegally exploit the mount and strip his land to the 
 community. 

 The Gutiérrez García brothers are a couple of bandits, converted into 
 landowners based on violence and paramilitarism, and today operate at service 
 of criminal groups, private companies and different levels of government than of 
 One way or another they want to impose the interoceanic corridor of the isthmus of

 07/01. During the recent protests, protesters blocked important 
 roads and bridges, attacked vehicles and demanded the conviction of the police 
 killers and the end of police violence. 

 Protests are a growth of a mobilization started by the family of 
 Nichols on 1/14, which guaranteed the resignation and conviction of the police 
 killers and the removal of two other reactionary military personnel involved in the 
 Case and three firefighters who were slow to provide help. 

 Last week protests began on January 27, hours 
 After the video filmed by the police camera of the police are released. 
 Hundreds of pasta took the streets of Memphis and blocked the I-55 bridge, which 
 Connects the states of Tennessee and Arkansas for about 3 hours. After 
 out of the bridge, protesters blocked the city streets and demanded 
 conviction of the police in front of the police station. Signs and posters with 
 say ** people demand: end with police terror!** and ** justice for type 
 Nichols ** were erected during the protests. 

 Still on 01/27, Georgia's reactionary governor, Brian Kemp, fearful 
 of a large mass survey in the country, decreed a state of emergency 
 preventive for the state. 

 ** Protests spread across the country **

 In Milwaukee, a protest occupied the _RED Arrow Park_ and headed to the barracks 
 general of the city's police department, where protesters demanded 
 Justice for Tyre Nichols and the end of police violence across the country. Arturo 
 Meboza, a protester, reported to the press monopoly _Milwaukee

 Nichols' death occurred less than three years ago of George's murder 
 Floyd, in 2020, the year in which thousands of American masses rose in 
 the whole country to demand the end of the murder of the black and poor population for 
 police. Since then, the country's police forces have raised the terror 
 against the country's masses in an attempt to prevent a new 
 Rebellion: Between 2020 and 2021, the number of deaths from USA police rose from 
 43 to 57.

 country, also rises the popular resistance against constant murders:

## To clarify 

## We are Marxist-Leninists-Maoists and we consider the one in progress in 
 Ukraine an interimperialist war between the USA/NATO/EU - including Italy and 
 Russian imperialism. The Zelensky government with the Nazis inside is a pawn 
 of imperialism and therefore does not defend nor the right of self -determination 
 of nations and less than ever the interests of the proletarians and popular masses e 
 So we support all those who fight him on a proletarian part 
 inside, as well as the similar forces in Russia that are against 
 The invasion and the dominant class in Russia. 

## Text 1 

## A DiaCono Oligarca under attack by Zelensky's penalties 

 Zelenskyy has imposed personal sanctions from the Security Council e 
 National defense to a series of religious figures of the UOC-MP [the Church 
 Ukrainian Orthodox of the Patriarchate of Moscow]. The most striking penalties do not 
 They concern both the clergy and the Oligorca Vadym Novynskyi. 

 Vadym Novynskyi, a deacon of the UOC-MP, is the richest Ukrainian eighth, with one 
 luck of over one billion US dollars. Has accumulated its capital in 
 Many sectors: from gas production, profitable in a moment of crisis 
 energy(la società è Enwell Energy), to participate of 25% in 
 Metinvest [giant of steel and iron], which he shares with the largest 
 exploiter of the country, Akhmetov. 

 The sanctions imposed by the President decree caused a series of 
 negative consequences for the businessman: the blockade of goods, the impossibility 
 to withdraw capital from Ukraine, the suspension of all operations 
 commercial, the cessation of all licenses for the use of the subsoil, 
 the ban on privatizing state properties and even the acquisition of the 
 properties of land plots. The goods 

 of Novynskyi will be saved only thanks to the early transfer of theirs 
 management to the child and some legal peculiarities, but only until the 
 state authorities will not begin to investigate his relatives and his 
 manager. Among other things, the sanctioned oligarch has successfully transferred the goods 
 of his holding at a Cypriot trust 6 days ago, which would have been 
 Impossible if the president had hurried to sign his order. But 
 We are not "daring", and therefore we know that the president defends 
 always and only the interests of the people and that there may not be his own 
 intrigues for business reasons. But because the capitalist Ukrainian state punishes 
 His opponer, who is an oligarch-monopolist? 

 The reasons have already been indicated in our numerous materials: ** the pressure 
 of the debt forces [the government] to transfer the profits to the wallets of the 
 Western imperialists through the mediation of state enterprises **. IS 
 was this economic interest, and not the fight against Russian spies 
 in the UOC-MP, to lead to the repression of this religious community, beyond 
 that to sanctions against individuals. These events are also a signal 
 For Mr. Akhmetov, because the example of his commercial partner/competitor 
 clearly shows what our oligarchs awaits in case of disobedience, 
 that is, if they do not accept they have a secondary role with respect to 
 western multinationals and their will, which is imposed through 
 The legal reforms of "European integration". 

 And the working class? We must perhaps support the defeat of the hated 
 Novinsky speculator? Or it is better to take over with the weakened oligarchy for 
 form a "large antimperialist democratic front"? Our answer to 
 These proposals are resolved: "No!". 

  

 After all, all the parties in conflict only fight to increase it 
 exploitation of common salaries, to profit from the war, which has 
 caused a huge increase in the price of raw materials, which are 
 Exporting from the country with unprecedented enthusiasm. And these forces are 
 even solidarity on the question of sending us to the front to die for "the 
 democracy, freedom and connection with the EU ". A democratic front 
 Effective and large antimperialist(dal momento che il 99% degli ucraini non
appartiene ai circoli più stretti dell'oligarchia finanziaria)it's possible 
 Only on condition that, under the flag and the slogans of internamentalism 
 proletarian and the establishment of a direct government of the working class, 
 the waged slaves of the capital Formino Militanti, organizations 
 For the defense of their rights, Marxist circles, etc. Such a front can 
 be guided only by the conscious part of the proletariat, that is, by a party 
 militant and determined proletarian. This is exactly the type of party 
 that we want!



 ** Text 2 ** ** Message from the workers of the Marxist Ukraine- 
 Leninist ** ** at the Rome event of 3 December ** 

 Dear Italian companions, 

 We, the Marxist-Leninist organization in front of Ukraine workers, 
 We write this letter to the Italian workers and communists in relation
Ukrainian workers and Russian workers kill each other for their profits 
 of the oligarchs that the restoration of capitalism has generated. This 
 situation [of war] is used by the leaders to strengthen the apparatus 
 repressive and introduce neoliberal antioperative laws, attributing the cause 
 of everything at the "war time". However, the war did not hit only i 
 Eastern Slavic peoples, who once had participated in the revolution 
 of October and fought side by side against the fascist yoke. In Europe yes 
 makes the pressure of the sanctions felt, which many of you perhaps already have 
 tried in person. While Russia wants to make one with military means 
 redistribution of influenza spheres, the western imperialists do not 
 only do not want to lose their influence in Ukraine, but they also succeed in 
 get the maximum profit from the supply of weapons. War opens new 
 markets to the bourgeoisie. If the Ukrainian government wins, the imperialists 
 Westerners will strengthen their position in our country; If the 
 Russian government, Russia will get new markets. And to every simple worker 
 It will be up to tolerating any humiliation and sanction. It doesn't matter who it is: Ukrainian, 
 Russian or Italian. Not for nothing the wife of our president, Elena 
 Zelenskaya, said the Ukrainians are ready to be without light and 
 Heating for two or even three years. Regardless of the outcome of the 
 events, the bourgeois ruling class will receive the maximum benefit, while the 
 working class of all countries will feel even more the weight of alienation 
 and exploitation. Even more the proletarians will begin to hear the 
 inequality on their skin, and anyone who does not agree will come 
 repressed by force. 

 This shows us once again that the workers of the different countries have 
 Many more things in common between them than with their capitalists. 

 That's why it is very important to fight against the escalation of conflicts from 
 All fronts of these conflicts. European communists must fight against 
 the introduction of NATO troops and the supply of weapons, while at 
 at the same time the Russian Communists must fight against the mobilization of 
 people at the front, develop feelings against war, and we communists 
 Ukrainians we must develop the class consciousness between the masses. Supply 
 of weapons, the introduction of the NATO troops will lead only to further 
 Blood spreads and the strengthening of the imperialist block. The crisis yes 
 it will develop even more. Ukrainian, Russian and European workers do 
 they will drown each other in the blood, and even more the mothers will not be 
 they will be able to wait for the return of their children from a war that will not bring 
 Nothing good. With the strengthening of the imperialists, the wars do not 
 they will end. Capital needs to increase, and imperialist countries 
 they are always ready to commit any crime that brings a profit of the 
 300%, right? This will only start the next wars. However, there is one 
 key to putting an end to this cycle [of war and exploitation]: the 
 socialism, in which every human being is brother of the other human being. 
 We greatly appreciate the fact that the Italian companions understand the meaning 
 of this conflict and how important the international unit of 
 workers. Italian communists, trade union activists, workers and students 
 Marxists, we wish you patience and determination in the fight against i 
 neo -fascists recently risen to power. Clearly distinguish between the 
 social scoreists who will always support their government or that of 
 someone else, for a doubt gain, betraying the interests of 
 workers. The importance of the struggle against socialsciovinism is the key 
 of the success of the revolutionary movement. It is necessary to explain to the workers 
 Because social scores are the enemies of the workers. It is also important 
 Explain to workers that neo -fascists are not their friends. 

 The fascists love to launch the left populists of the left, gaining like this 
 the support of the people. This is how our extremists were deceived 
 right, and yours act in the same way. Meloni's interview 
 she was very revealing, when she said she was very worried about the fact that 
 French colonialism still exists, ignoring the presence of 
 Italian multinationals in the countries of the suburbs. Our old 
 left generation, which existed before 2013-2014, failed to 
 cope with this task. Many have openly supported the LDPR or the 
 Maidan's coup, many have underestimated the far -right forces 
 because of their marginality. However, we have the opportunity to fix 
 Everything, just like Italians have a great chance of strengthening the 
 Communist movement. 

 In conclusion, I would like to recall a classic quote that will never lose 
 its relevance until the workers fight against this system of
_ The translations in Italian are taken from ** Red sting ** _

 It will never be late enough, will never be excessive or sufficient, the effort in 
 denounce - to the four winds - the deletion and tergiversation strategies 
 conveyed by the media and advertising(públicos e/ou privados)from the 
 bourgeois press; as well as through their ideologues and ‘Institutes of 
 teaching and research ', or through their agencies and programs of 
 financing to distribute research and training scholarships, 
 advanced studies, curriculum packages, credit lines to contemplate the 
 always new reinterpretations about the historical past and its 
 unfolding to the reading of the present. Sometimes, such a mechanism imposes itself on 
 insidious and sublimate form. Other, under the decrees 
 Official ordinances, policies entered by shift governments. Is 
 Operate arrangements, adjustments, corrections and conversions, frames to the conclusion. 
 One is populating in layers and layers of toxic smoke the unstoppable primacy 
 of the facts. 

 **two** 

 Jorge Amado, in his soap opera The Death and the Death of Quincas Berro D'Agua(1959), 
 offers us needle and line to this argument - albeit from the prism of the 
 Literary fabulation. Is that one time, one day like any other, perhaps 
 that after a homerical boring of a bad cachaça, perhaps that the accumulation of the 
 mishaps and unruly, behold, the patriarch of the dirty and 
 Ratches of the Port Zone, Mretricity and Ladeira do Tabuão, no longer 
 He raised the body of his nail bed. It was hopelessly dead. Without 
 Prior announcement, without the early verdict of a diagnosis that condemned it. 
 This is simply dead. Who knows if a fulminating or 
 a sudden harm. To the companions of all hours, Curió, Black Pastinha, Cabo 
 Martim, Foot of Time, Master Manuel, Quiteria of the wide eye, the day out of 
 Scare, suspension, drunkenness and evocation. However, this was just one of the 
 halves of the death of Quincas. The other half would be that of the adjustment, the 
 arrangement, the corrections in the color palette, that of its gradual mixture in the 
 intensity and tone control. Is that the family of yore(a que
Quincas abandonara há tempos por não lhe suportar as injunções de classe...)He had advanced and took to himself the reins of the situation. It would be necessary to clean the dead 
 under the pretext of care for memory; It would be essential to leave it 
 the expertise of the skillful hands of the funeral farm experts; arrange 
 a priest to the pasture of his soul under perdition; It would be necessary to wear it 
 in casimira suit, sock and thin -toe shoes, a scarf in the upper pocket, 
 the cushion that encourages the neck's discomfort; the appared of 
 nails, the haircut, the concealer to the dark circles, the base of the face; it would be 
 labels and good manners to perfum it to the arrangement of field lilies, the 
 Preparation of the campaign, the crowns of flowers, the phrase written by the tomb. 
 In one word, it was necessary and urgent to end once and for all 
 Screaming of water, ending it from end to head and resurfaced, even though 
 stillborn, Joaquim Soares da Cunha, that good, shy and obedient husband and 
 father. As in the terms of Jorge Amado: 

 It didn't even seem like the same dead(https://anovademocracia.com.br...)It was like finally tamed 
 Quincas, as if the reins had again, those that he 
 She had ripped off a strong hand from Otacilia [his wife], laughing in her face. THE 
 Shadow of a smile emerged on Vanda's lips [her daughter].(https://anovademocracia.com.br...)Felt 
 avenged from everything that made the family suffer, especially 
 own and Otacily. That humiliation of years and years. Ten years took Joaquim 
 This absurd life. King of the Bahia Tramps ... I wish Vanda at this time of 
 Intimate satisfaction, of pure victory, being generous and good. Forget the last 
 ten years, as if the competent men of the funeral home had purified them 
 with the same wet rag in soap with which they removed the dirt from the body of 
 Quincas [1].

 In his book Rodolfo Walsh - Los Años Montoneros, Hugo Montero and Ignacio 
 Portela draw attention to a certain cleaning and adequacy operation 
 for much of the Argentine essay literature about its recent past 
 and, more specifically, about Rodolfo Walsh's 'path' 
 closed on March 25, 1977. 

 About this fateful day we evoke some data: it had passed exactly a year(e
um dia)the coup d'état that inaugurated the last of the military dictatorships in the 
 Argentina, euphemistically self -enhanced national reorganization process; 
 Rodolfo Walsh, 2nd Officer of the Military Political Organization Montoneros, Head of 
 Intelligence sector, active activist of its information structure, 
 He had worked intensively in the construction of a bomb letter in which 
 publicly denounced the crimes of life injury planned by its policy
and incarceration in concentration and extermination camps, mass murders 
 and forced disappearance of thousands of workers, political militants, 
 Leaders and union and student staff. The letter, the trip of 
 train from the Bonaerense periphery to Estación Constitución, with a folder 
 containing two dozen mimeographed copies, packaged in envelopes 
 closed with several destination and left in mailboxes on the streets of the 
 Argentine capital. Walsh would still have a meeting with a companion from 
 Organization, however, this meeting had not been given. Is that the militant had been arrested, 
 And under torture, he had denounced a local time and the 'with whom' of the meeting. 
 It was Walsh, a large fish, hyper sought after, living in 
 clandestinity clenched. To the schools of the school's tasks group 
 Armada Mechanics(ESMA)It would be the opportunity arranged to the top hat. 
 From among the sicaries was Alfredo Astiz. 

 Rodolfo Walsh had resisted bravely making use of his Walter PPK pistol, 
 22 caliber on the other side, endless gust and spill it. Walsh 
 It would not be one of the kidnapped, would not be one of the captured. However it will not take 
 with the cyanide tablet that saved so many of the horror of the denunciation under 
 The most atrocious of physical and mental tortures. Nor did it carry the hand grenade 
 that, according to his companion Lilia Ferreyra, he used to leave reserved 
 for the last minute - in which a meeting with the jokes if we armed a 
 Inviolable siege. To that March 25, 1977 had been the last time the 
 Rodolfo Walsh. Your body would never be found. There were testimonials that 
 They attest to the ultimate courage of this Montonero Walsh. 

 Despite this, and in the course of the historical fact, let's see what 
 points out the testimony of Hugo Montero and Ignacio Portela: 

 Evidently that there is a certain factor that bothers the progressive perspective of the 
 Argentine history. Particularly, that of some chroniclers of the recent past 
 who are concerned with rescuing the transcendent literary work, the rigorous craft 
 journalistic and the unalterable intellectual commitment, but that is embarrassed, 
 doubt and choose eufemisms and ambiguities to account for the last steps 
 of Walsh in the guerrilla. Like a hedgehog that pierces everyone who touches the 
 these violent times, the combatant role of Rodolfo Walsh restless, molest, 
 bother. Is that something of all this does not fit the reconstruction 
 politically correct from the chroniclers of the past, those who want to entangle the 
 Walsh, at most, in the parameters of commitment and audacity, but that, of 
 skilled form, avoid defining it as guerrilla. [2] 

 Species of operation cleaning in the fashion of the house in which the good manners strives. 
 Make the dead man's dead or heroic death rumors. Dismiss 
 gives him the reasons in which he was entered. And it is made it chant like in a vibrate 
 a Joaquim Soares da Cunha there where what was all waved 
 Boosts to scream for water. And Norberto Freyre, teacher 
 retired English, name password of the clandestinity of the 'Walsh path', there 
 where the canon is supported by the great writer Rodolfo Walsh, to sit at the table 
 with Jorge Luis Borges - who, on the occasion, had greeted the genocide Jorge Rafael 
 Videla with your bird, Caesar!And cleaning and rescue is made at one time. 
 However, it is not a question of rescuing the historical fact to the contradictions 
 and the conflicts that made him inevitable. First, it is about chasing it to 
 Eyes of later - as one who enters the floor incaining traces and traces. 
 Will define the will of submitting what was, in its severity, in its 
 weighing, in its intensity and strength, to the moral and judicial sieve that season 
 History to the sweet flute of the narratives. 

 To make use of the poetic word, it would risk saying that despite this 
 deletion, of this contuman tergiversation, of this malicious laundry 
 fabulation, so many and so many times will escape a balloon a halo where 
 will shout us the unavoidable spectrum of the fact. This one that accumulates 
 inheritance of the people who fight. 

 Therefore the complaint complains will never be enough. This is what suggests to us 
 Word needs Rodolfo Walsh: 

 Our ruling classes have always sought to make workers not 
 Have history, do not have doctrine, do not have heroes and martyrs. Each fight 
 should start over, amputated from previous fights: the collective experience 
 Loses, the lessons are forgotten. The story in this way becomes property 
 private whose owners are the owners of all things.

 On the 80th anniversary of the Victoria de Stalingrad 



 In its 'political declaration and principles' the International Communist League, 
 just z correctly declared: "We assume the position of President Mao on 
 The role of Comrade Stalin that he has been a great Marxist. Also, have 
 in mind that it has been he who brilliantly defined Leninism. The 
 Communists today have the task of assuming the defense of their role in the second 
 World War, in the Communist International, particularly in its VII 
 World Congress. "The latter will be central to this article that celebrates the 
 Tremendous victory in the battle of Stalingrad. 



 The weight and significance of this great and heroic battle were correctly 
 established by President Mao Tse-Tung: "This battle is not just the point 
 of inflection of the Soviet-German war, or even of the current war 
 anti -fascist World, is the turning point in the history of the entire 
 humanity." 



 The war fought by the USSR, as it was absolutely defined 
 Correct, it was a great homeland war, a fair war of defense. In addition to 
 the glorious and heroic defense, in which the USSR under the direction of the 
 Comrade Stalin had to apply the burned land to defend his 
 territory, to defend the socialist homeland, which cost more than 25 
 Millions of lives, the anti -imperialist struggle was greatly developed in the 
 oppressed nations during this period. 



 President Mao Tse-Tung thought fairly and correctly: „The sacred war of 
 resistance of the Soviet Union against fascist aggression is not only 
 in self -defense, but in defense of all nations fighting for 
 free yourself from fascist slavery. For communists around the world 
 task now consists of mobilizing the peoples of all countries and 
 Organize an international united front to fight fascism and 
 defend the Soviet Union, defend China and defend freedom and 
 Independence of all nations. " 



 The peoples of the world rose for the fair cause and spilled their 
 beautiful blood not only in the war against the axis, but also against their 
 respective imperialist masters, which initiated the great anti -colonial struggle in the 
 Second half of the 20th century. TH 



 In the winter of 1941/42, the Soviet Union, under the direction and command 
 From Comrade Stalin, he had already successfully rejected a fierce Nazi-German attack 
 On the western part of the country, with the aim of taking the capital, 
 Moscow. The Nazi Wehrmacht, unable to understand that every attempt to crush 
 The Bolshevistic steel tempered by Great Lenin and Stalin was sentenced to 
 Failure, set up an offensive on southern Russia in the summer of 1942 \. 
 They put their sights in Stalingrad, because the city served as a center 
 Industrial in Russia, producing, among other important goods, artillery 
 For the country's troops. The Volga River, which crosses the city, was also 
 an important sea route that connected the western part of the country with 
 its distant oriental regions. The Nazis wanted the Wehrmacht to occupy 
 Stalingrad, seeing its value for propaganda purposes, since it carried the 
 Stalin name. For similar moral reasons there was a special need 
 to defend it. The 6th Army of the Wehrmacht began its assault on 
 August 1942. 



 Comrade Stalin, as a supreme command, personally dictated order 227, to 
 end of July 1942, in order to raise the level of sacrifices and the 
 Armed forces struggle at the level of the people: 



 „The enemy launches new forces in front regardless of the great losses 
 and penetrates deeply into the Soviet Union, seizing new 
 regions, destroying our cities and villages, and violating, looting and 
 killing the Soviet population. It fights in the Voronej region, nearby 
 of the gift, in the south, and at the gates of the northern Caucasus. The invaders 
 Germans penetrate to Stalingrad, at the Volga and want at all costs to catch 
 Kuban and the Northern Caucasus, with their oil and cereals. […] Part of the 
 South Front troops, following panic sowers, have abandoned 
 Rostov and Novochercassk without opposing hard resistance and without orders from Moscow, 
 covering its banners with shame. 



 The population of our country, who loves and respects the Red Army, begins to 
 to discourage in it, and lose faith in the Red Army, and many curse the 
 Red Army for leaving our town under the yoke of the oppressors
Calman speaking that we can retire more to the east, since we have 
 A lot of territory, a lot of land, a lot of population and that there will always be a lot of bread 
 for us. They want to justify the infamous behavior in the front. But 
 Such words is falsehood, useful only for our enemies. 



 Each commander, soldier of the Red Army and political commissioner must 
 Understand that our means are not unlimited. The territory of the State 
 Soviet is not a desert, but people: workers, peasants, 
 intellectuals, our fathers, mothers, wives, brothers, children. He 
 territory of the USSR that the enemy has captured and intends to capture is bread and 
 other products for the army, metal and fuel for the industry, 
 factories, plants that supply weapons and ammunition to the army, 
 Railways. After the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, the republics 
 Baltic, Donetzk and other areas have much less territory, much less 
 People, bread, metal, plants and factories. We have lost more than 70 million 
 people, more than 800 million pounds of bread a year and more than 10 million 
 tons of metal a year. […] Back more - means wasting us 
 ourselves and waste our homeland at the same time. Therefore, 
 It is necessary to eliminate the speech that we have the ability to retreat 
 endless, that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that 
 There is a large population, and that bread will always be abundant. Such speech is 
 false and parasitic, weakens and benefits the enemy, if we do not stop 
 We will go without bread, without fuel, without metal, without subjects 
 premiums, without factories and plants, without railways. This leads us to 
 Conclusion, it's time to finish back. Not a step back![…] Is 
 impossible to tolerate that the commanders and commissioners allow the units 
 Leave their positions. It is impossible to tolerate that the commanders and 
 commissioners admit that some panic propagators determined 
 situation in the combat field and took other soldiers in departure and 
 They opened the enemy against the enemy. The propagadores must be exterminated in situ 
 of panic and cowards. 



 Hereafter, the solid law of discipline for each commander, soldier 
 of the Red Army and Commissioner must be the requirement: not a single step back without 
 Superior command order. Companies of Companies, Battalions, 
 regiments and divisions, as well as the corresponding commissioners, which 
 They go back without orders from the upper controls, they are traitors to the homeland. 
 These are the orders of our homeland. Execute this order - means 
 defend our land, save the homeland, exterminate and conquer the hated 
 enemy." 



 Our heroic red soldiers initially stop the advances of 
 The Wehrmacht during a series of skirmishes north of Stalingrad, 
 offering more than 200,000 lives, and contained Nazi hordes successfully. 
 It was decided not to flee but resist and, therefore, not evacuate the more than 400,000 
 people of the city. Men and women, even the youngest, 
 Stalingrad joined war -related activities: 
 Combat, construction, espionage, supply, etc. Even when 
 Stalingrad walls burst by the constant bombings of the Luftwaffe 
 Or the strong artillery attacks, the people remained firm. 



 Operation Uranus, directed by Georgy Zhukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky, 
 He organized Russian troops in the mountains north and west of the city. 
 From there they launched a counterattack. Paying the necessary price, the army 
 Red was able to surround the city at the end of November 1942, catching 
 The almost 300,000 German and axis soldiers(principalmente italianos y
rumanos), drowning the enemy forces of vital supplies and 
 essentially surrounding them in an increasingly tight rope. 



 Near Stalingrad, the Red Army won important battles, even in 
 Rostov del Don, about 250 kilometers from Stalingrad. Thus, the forces 
 enemies were thinned and stretched on that part of the front and the operation 
 Little Saturn in western Stalingrad succeeded. With men, not with 
 weapons, demonstrating once again than the Marxist principle about what is most 
 important was correct, they strangled the invaders until death and 
 They fought the greatest war battle in cities ever seen. It was not a war 
 Only of street by street, neither from home by house or basement for basement, nor 
 Even from floor on the floor, but room in room, generating the largest 
 Heroism, chapters that have shuddered the world. 



 On the importance of the battle of Stalingrad for the entire course of the 
 Guerra, President Mao declared: „… In this current war the attack on 
 Stalingrad is the expression of the last desperate struggle of his own 
 fascism. Also at this decisive moment in history, many people from
Fascism and have not known how to discern their essence. For forty -eight days 
 He fought an fierce battle unprecedented in the history of mankind: 
 Since August 23, when all German forces crossed the curve of the 
 Don River and initiated the total attack against Stalingrad, until 15 of 
 September, when some German units broke into the district 
 industrial of the northwestern part of the city, and until October 9, 
 When the Soviet Information Office announced that the Red Army had 
 Broken the German fence line in that district. Finally, this battle was 
 won by Soviet forces. During those forty -eight days, 
 News from each setback or triumph of that city seized hearts 
 of countless millions of people, sometimes causing them anxiety, sometimes 
 causing euphoria. This battle is not just the turning point of the 
 Soviet-German war, or even the current anti-fascist World War, 
 It is the turning point in the history of all mankind. Throughout 
 These forty -eight days, the peoples of the world observed stalingrad with 
 an even greater concern of what Moscow observed last October. […] 
 After the battle for the Defense of Stalingrad, the situation will be totally 
 different from last year. On the one hand, the Soviet Union will launch a 
 Second large -scale winter counteroffensive, Great Britain and states 
 United can no longer delay the opening of the second front(aunque todavía no
se puede predecir la fecha exacta), and the peoples of Europe will be prepared 
 To get up in response. On the other hand, Germany and its accomplices 
 Europeans will no longer have strength to mount large -scale offensives, and Hitler 
 You will have no alternative than changing your entire political line towards the 
 Strategic defensive. " 



 We all know, and we must remember that the fascist offensive directed by the 
 Nazis, to which the Italian and Spanish fascists contributed and others like 
 The Romanians, the Hungarian and also the Panda of Flag Rats of Ukraine, and 
 that used all the economic power of the Europe submitted, launched to the 
 Invasion to millions of millions, to the flower of the German army, to the 
 75% of its Air Force. But comrade Stalin had wisely handled the 
 Diplomacy with great subtlety. 



 It is worth highlighting the sagacity and penetration of the intelligence service 
 Soviet. What an intelligence service. Knew the exact day of the 
 Nazi invasion. 



 The Soviet Union applied a strategic defense together with the burned earth, 
 that left them more than destroyed land, mud, ashes and the more partisans 
 brave, determined and resolved behind the enemy lines. They had the 
 boldness, the value of flying monumental works such as the famous dam that unites the 
 Volga with the gift that cost so many years of effort. The Germans never 
 They dreamed, they thought this work would not be flown, because it was too much 
 Important and had cost a lot. 



 The dictatorship of the proletariat was at stake, the revolution was at stake, 
 We cannot stop to think, nor can we simply make ourselves hinder, like 
 President Mao said for the defense of centimeters of land. HE 
 They crashed at the gates of Leningrad, at the gates of Moscow and 
 Stalingrad; but not only that. The burned land was carried out, but the 
 guerrillas and even simple individual men and women with their rifles, 
 His ammunition and vodka waited for the enemy. To annihilate one of those 
 Brave heroes and heroines, the Germans lost an average of 10 men. 



 The fascist offensive was a very high quality military plan, thus, the most 
 High and enlightened German military chiefs elaborated this plan and the school 
 German has a war tradition often proven: in three months 
 They planned to conquer the USSR. 



 The forecast of Comrade Stalin, had already taken measures since the 30s 
 When the great transformation of the field and industry occurred, already 
 They had transferred factories beyond the urales, even providing for the 
 possibility of reaching Moscow, because it is true, everything was 



 already underway in the end they could not defend Moscow, although that was the 
 decision made, it was already planned to transfer the address and the center to the 
 Urales; So the first thing that was done was to take provisions for the 
 Lenin's transfer, because he could not fall into the dirty hands of the miserable 
 Children of hell, I couldn't fall. 



 But the order, after they had penetrated to the aforementioned doors, 
 The order was not to go back anymore!It is very memorable, and we must always remember 
 how on November 7, anniversary of the revolution, they had nowhere 
 celebrate it and it was considered impossible to carry it out; Comrade Stalin 
 He said: "To the station", "but there is no platform, there are no seats", the 
 Comrade Stalin got on a box and spoke to celebrate the revolution, 
 saying: "How many of us were there when we took power, what
After the October revolution? We will crush them and annihilate the 
 Beast in his own den, in Berlin. " 



 These are things to remember, to appreciate Comrade Stalin you have to look 
 to World War II. We all know how the great 
 resistance, the rupture of the German lines, the Stalingrad site, where 
 German commanders, Hitler himself, ordered them not to retire 
 before those lower subhumans. Those lower, the barbarians, the Mongols, 
 They hunt them as rats and had to surrender. 



 It is always good to reiterate it: Stalin, skilled and wise war manager, 
 It always took into account the moral element and made all the Nazis parade 
 defeated and rendered and threw their flags, their eagles, their swastikas to the 
 Lenin's mausoleum feet; Not only a great military defeat, but a 



 Great moral defeat!Nazi arrogance had been sunk in the mud and 
 trampled, it was the greatest moral blow I had ever received, and that was the 
 Beginning of the Nazi Wehrmacht. 



 In February 1943, Comrade Stalin analyzed: „Three months ago the troops of the 
 Red Army began their offensive in the access to Stalingrad. Since 
 Then the initiative in military operations has remained in our 
 hands and rhythm and attack of the offensive operations of the 
 Red Army have not weakened. Today, in hard winter conditions, the 
 Red Army advances on a 1,500 kilometers front and gets successes 
 practically everywhere. In the north, near Leningrad, on the front 
 Central, in the accesses to Kharkov, in the Donets basin, in Rostov, in the 
 Real and Black Sea Sea shores, the Red Army advises coup after 
 Hitler troops blow. In three months the Red Army has released from 
 enemy the territory of the regions of Voronezh and Stalingrad, the 
 Autonomous Republics of Cheheno-Ingushetia, northern Osetia, Kabardino- 
 Balakaria and Kalmyk, the territories of Stavropol and Krasnodar, the regions 
 Cherkess autonomous(Circasia), Karachaisu and Adygeisu and almost all of 
 The regions of Rostov, Kharkov and Kursk. 



 […] Only in the winter of 1942-43, the Germans lost more than 7,000 
 tanks, 4,000 airplanes, 17,000 cannons [...] since the beginning of the war, has 
 Fighting about 9,000,000 officers and German men 
 fascists, of which no less than 4,000,000 died in the field of 
 battle. 



 […] First, the weakness of the German army is the shortage of 
 labor reserves and, consequently, it is not known which sources 
 These losses will replace. […] The Red Army has become an army 
 experienced. […] Millions of red army men have become 
 Masters of their weapons […] 



 It cannot be considered a coincidence that the Red Army command not only 
 release the enemy's Soviet floor, but not allow the enemy 
 He leaves our soil alive, carrying out such important operations as 
 the siege and annihilation of enemy armies that can well serve as 
 Examples of military art. This is, without a doubt, a sign of the maturity of 
 Our commanders. 



 There is no doubt that only the correct strategy of the Red Army command, and 
 The flexible tactic of our commanders who execute it could be 
 as a result as an outstanding fact as the fence and annihilation 
 in Stalingrad of a huge army chosen by Germans, which had 
 330,000 men. " 



 Our Brazilian comrades pointed out: the victory against fascism in the 
 World War II is one of the great historical events of 
 Proletarian world revolution process, the imperialist field was found 
 deeply beaten, three important imperialist powers were 
 defeated - Germany, Japan and Italy - what has to be seriously 
 studied for its fair and correct understanding, it has to be highlighted and 
 celebrated. 



 The Communist Party of China said, regarding the evaluation of this 
 Historical experience: 



 „First, the history of the anti -fascist war shows that the 
 Socialist system has enormous vitality that can resist the most 
 Severa and that a state of dictatorship of the proletariat is invincible. 



 Secondly, the history of anti -fascist war demonstrates that 
 Imperialism is the source of all wars of modern times, that the 
 aggressive nature of imperialism will not change and that, therefore, to 
 Defend world peace is necessary to persist in the fight against 
 imperialism. 



 Third, the history of anti -fascist war demonstrates that war 
 of the peoples is safe to achieve victory, which is completely 
 possible to defeat the imperialist aggressors, that imperialism is a 
 paper tiger, apparently strong, but really weak, and that the pump 
 Atomic is also a paper tigress and it is the people and not the weapons, of
Fourth, the history of the anti -fascist war shows that, to 
 defeat the imperialist aggressor, it is imperative to trust the unity of the 
 revolutionary forces of the peoples of all countries, attract our 
 side to all the forces that can be won, form the single front 
 broader international possible and concentrate our blows on the enemy 
 main of the peoples of the world. " 



 Under the weapons of the glorious red army, Nazi Germany was shattered, the 
 Socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat arose even in the Germany of the 
 This. The red flag of the Communist Party and the USSR waving on the 
 overshadowed and destroyed German Reichstag is an undeniable great moment of 
 international proletariat that symbolizes all the heroic and glorious epic of 
 the fight against fascism in defense of the USSR and for the development of the 
 World proletarian revolution. The phrase pronounced by comrade Dimitrov 
 when he embarked on the direction of USSR after the great victory in the 
 Nazi court in Leipzig was fulfilled as follows: "We will Soviet to Germany!"

![](Images/salvadormotoristas2.jpg)Manifestation of drivers and application delivery on 01/30 in Salvador(BA). Photo: Reproduction/ good morning ba 

 During the month of January, application delivery people throughout Brazil 
 held strikes and demonstrations in the capitals of the states of São Paulo, Rio 
 January, Bahia, Acre, Rio Grande do Sul, Piauí, among others. You 
 workers are demanding the most elementary rights to exercise 
 profession. In cities in the state of São Paulo, tired of overexploitation, the 
 deliveries even declared strike indefinitely until they had their 
 Requirements met by monopoly _Ifood_. In Salvador(BA)the delivery 
 They blocked the main roads of the city on several days. 

 Among the claims of all these workers were: increased rate 
 minimum paid for delivery of $ 6 to $ 8; end of double or triple deliveries, 
 When the delivery man performs two or more races being paid only by one; 
 insurance in case of an accident or death, since the coverage offered by the 
 _Iifood_ do not work in practice; and end of logistics operators(OL’s), what 
 function as intermediaries between delivery and applications and are 
 responsible for the outsourcing of workers. 

 Application deliveries have struggled for these basic rights for years. You 
 delivery monopolies, in turn, seek to prevent in all ways that 
 workers conquer these rights, since, in the face of another crisis 
 on a world scale, monopolies dependent on foreign companies(imperialistas), like _Ifood_ and _UBER_, seek to achieve profits each time 
 larger to escape the crisis. 

 The situation of these workers is aggravated by the crisis of capitalism 
 Brazilian bureaucratic, which through the different reactionary governments of 
 All spheres throws the consequences on the back of the popular mass 
 of the serious situation in which the country is sunk. In 2022, a 
 Survey of _Fairwork_ Brazil showed that platform workers 
 Digital earn an average of $ 5.50 per hour and less than one minimum wage in the month. 

 Government after government promises to regulate the profession. 
 None of them comply to make the relationship between delivery and monopoly 
 as a de facto employment bond. The Government of Ultrarectionary Jair 
 Bolsonaro even promised to demand from the platforms contribution to the 
 Social Security. Opportunist Minister Luiz Inacio told companies that 
 “They were not scared”, because the proposal would only be to bring “social protection” to 
 worker. In any case, the situation only worsens day after day. 

 With the current strike and protests, the deliveries demarcate their independence, 
 classism and combativity against the opportunistic position to promote the 
 Immobilism in exchange for meetings and crumbs. 

 ** Check below how the delivery manifestations were 
 country:** 

 ** SP: Deliveners perform four days strike ** 

 On 01/25, in São Paulo(capital), hundreds of deliveries performed a 
 strike all day. The protesters gathered in the parking lot of the 
 Shopping Metro Itaquera, on José Pinheiro Borges Avenue. They claimed 
 receive for each delivery and better working conditions. 

 Geronimo Lima Gusmão, 32, leadership of the East Zone delivery 
 Paulo, said that "there is a huge gulf between the government, the state and the 
 motorcycles of self -employed applications, _Ifood_ is giving four orders to 
 People deliver and we will only receive [payment for] two. Only customers 
 They paid for four deliveries. And it was not like that [earlier]. We received 
 all deliveries. A year ago it changed. " 

 Geronimo has been working for three years in the profession and has suffered five accidents in 
 work schedule. "We are exhausted, we can't take it anymore," said the 
 Worker on the lack of rights to local radio Itatiaia. 

 In cities in the interior of the state, as in Diadema, the deliveries continued 
 on strike until 01/29. In Indaiatuba, the workers said that 
 will remain on strike indefinitely, until the motoboys are 
 served by _Ifood_. 

 In the city of Santa Bárbara d'Oeste, the deliveries concentrated in front 
 to Tivoli Shopping on 01/25. Delivery Rodrigo Cucatti, 38, 
 said to the local newspaper every day: "Today is being a warning. If they do not help

tGzOXU83jTFcFFSQgTTvpeXnIvo9CtNmembNQF9i2EaCbULw/s892/lecce.JPG)_Lunedi 'an assembly in Lecce organized by the Casa del Popolo was held. 
 with the intervention of the lawyer Gianluca Vitale, legele of the college of defense 
 of the defendants of the "Scripta Manent" trial and the companion of Taranto, 
 Margherita Calderazzi, for proletarian red rescue. After the presentation 
 And these two interventions were questions to the lawyer. Vital, others 
 interventions, debate ._ 

  ** We report here the intervention of Taranto's partner ** 

 They are from the Slai Cobas SC and the Slai Cobas supports and it is part of an organism 
 created some time ago, the proletarian red rescue that carries on one 
 battle of solidarity and support for struggles against the repression of 
 State, in particular towards political prisoners. 

 Unfortunately, they have become a little "expert" of 41bis, because for a while of 
 years, since 2015 we have started to make a continuous campaign and gradually 
 extended to Nadia Lioce which is one of the few political prisoners in 41bis, 
 Among other things, the only woman who has been in 41bis for 18 years. We made a series 
 of initiatives, principals to L'Aquila where Nadia Lioce, events, is held, 
 We brought the Nadia Lioce issue in national events, in 
 particular those of women on November 25 in Rome, etc.; for this 31 
 companions and companions were reported for having made these principals e 
 initiatives and the process is still underway. 

 But there was a question. Nadia Lioce in order to have a minimum of entry in 
 A period had made jokes with a plastic bottle on 
 rallies of his cell, for this he had been tried. To this process 
 We have made constant protest initiatives together with others, extending 
 mobilization also towards the area of democrats, lawyers; we collected 
 signatures before the courts saying that Nadia Lioce was brigatist, that 
 it claims to be of the BR, but has been in many years in 41bis 
 without having objectively the possibility of interning or having influence 
 on the external organization given that, as the lawyer also said Vital, this 
 Organization of the BR has been no longer for a few years. 

 In our opinion, solidarity was important. And here in part I start to 
 respond to the question that the partner who introduced this 
 Assembly placed before: what do we do? On that occasion we saw that 
 We do not accepting the prohibitions that the 

 Police imposed, for example. not to make garrisons in front of the prison of L'Aquila, 
 Entering the court, the solidarity has weighed; at least this process 
 He did not end with a further sentence; Of course we are talking about "further 
 condemns "when Nadia Lioce still is in 41bis and for her it is a 
 life sentence, but they wanted to further weigh down his condition. Not 
 they succeeded. 

 This must give us strength and trust. It looks like, and here I come to Alfredo Cosato, 
 as they are dealing with Alfredo's situation, for the fury from 
 revenge that the state, the government are making, for recent statements 
 of Meloni, it seems that there is no possibility that Alfredo comes out of 
 41bis. We do not accept this!

 We think that initiatives are important, of all kinds and types, and here 
 Everyone is good that he does what he can do and that he is also in tune with the 
 own ideology, politics, practice, from the actions that the 
 anarchists, as struggling with positions, complaints, sides that come 
 made, for example, also some artists, as the first lawyers, some 
 intellectuals, etc., to the principals, events, etc. 

 Because this is the path that we must continue and extend, bringing it 
 forward articulatedly, because every action, from a signature to the signature to 
 A heavier action is needed. 

 We have also had another experience on this in past years. Years 
 ago there was a partner who had launched a bowler hat towards a military base, 
 He had only blacked the wall but had been sentenced to dozens, tens of years, 
 The campaign that was made in that case, very extensive, without resigning 
 facing the difficulties led to the liberation of the partner. 

  

 Coming to the affair of Alfredo Cossed, we called 41bis "Torture 
 Bianca ". It is a torture that has the only purpose of revenge towards 
 Those who do not regret, do not collaborate with the state, rather claim the 
 their revolutionary militancy, and this Alfredo so does it. 

 A revenge towards companions who objectively and subjectively launch a 
 message, to fight against the repression of the state, not to yield, of 
 pursue this battle. 

 In Taranto, where we started making initiatives, even putting
We will do others, we are saying together with; "Outside Alfredo thus from 41bs. No 
 to obstacle life imprisonment "," save his life and his political identity ". 
 I want to underline this last sentence: its political identity ", why 
 As Cospito's letter also says: life does not make sense in this grave 
 of the living. 

 So his political identity. Now, we are not anarchists and we have 
 relevant differences in ideological, political, strategic, terms of 
 perspective with anarchists. But the problem is not this now. The problem is 
 The political identity that the bourgeois state wants to erase and hit. 

 In this sense I add to what vital denounced on the matter 
 Judicial, which this of Cosenza is a political question. And because therefore it is 
 It is right that solidarity is also solidarity with political identity 
 Revolutionary of Alfredo Cossed. 

 Because it is the state that puts it on a political level, it would not make sense if not 
 It was political. Now torture, 41bis have no relationship with the 
 crime in itself: what relationship is there between the fact that he has blacked a wall and the end 
 life? what relationship there is between the "bond, influence towards the outside" of Cosenza e 
 The 41bis regime? Nothing!We are seeing it in these days: the anarchists 
 They are doing various actions without Alfredo influenced them; then one can have 
 A positive or negative judgment, but they are doing it. The problem that the 
 bond with the outside is more creating the action of the judiciary, of 
 Government, of the state that Alfredo Cosenza. 

 So if there is no longer the bond with the crime, it actually emerges that 
 The only purpose is political. "Cut" the heads of revolutionaries, detainees 
 politicians, because for the mere fact of carrying out their battle, 
 they allude to the question that this state must be reversed, allude to 
 the fact that the state cannot be reversed with words but with the struggle 
 Army, mass. Therefore, for the mere fact that it alludes, for better or worse, a 
 This truth must then be silenced in a tomb. Why this 
 Both a message both inside the prisons and outside. 

 Of course, the Alfredo so -called issue was not born with the Meloni government, but now 
 It is fully taken in hand by the Meloni government. In the sense that today 
 It must be prevented that there are struggles that also go beyond the needs 
 concrete, daily, immediate, concrete, which pose the problem of power, 
 of what power, if this power can or cannot be improved, reformed, 
 Because it is a power of the dominant class that does not have the right to exist. AND 
 Today there is an objective situation that increasingly raises this question, because 
 Not only is the crisis, now there is war, and things are changing 
 quickly; and in a sense this, on the front of both needs 
 daily work, salary, of not having caravan, of rights 
 elementary, both of the most general rights, to democracy, rights of 
 immigrants, women, health, school, etc., creates a malaise 
 heavier among the workers, among the popular masses. 

 In this situation, those who want to give a perspective must be removed 
 To this strong malaise. 

 I read you a excerpt released a few days ago, in which Nadia's lawyer 
 Lioce, Caterina Calia, resumes what is written in a provision that 
 confirmed the 41bis for Nadia: _ "must be evaluated with the utmost prudence the 
 temporary excluded of the brigatist phenomenon that suggest not to exclude the 
 Possibility of a recovery of the armed struggle in the medium and long term, 
 also in consideration of an overall panorama of social clashes, of a 
 ever growing gap of living conditions and little opportunities for 
 Work"_ 

 And you say it ...!And what should we say? Well yes'. The problem is that the 
 situation is worsening and now the war is also, there is participation 
 to the war of Italy who wants to be in the front row. 

 This can be a ground in which not only struggles can develop 
 trade unions, but more heated, tougher struggles and these struggles can then be 
 meet with the revolutionaries, the communists or anarchists who place the 
 problem of a more general struggle, of a struggle to make it really 
 With such a barbaric situation. 

 I remember what some time ago in a long interview made to Vitale, at a certain point 
 the discussion that the action of the judiciary was made, the repressive action is 
 internal to the class struggle, to the class war. Then if it is internal to the 
 Class struggle, force relationships count. 

 In the 70s the same judiciary or because he was convinced or because he had 
 fear was a little calmer, or at least there was a rift, between whom 
 He also wanted to condemn the revolutionaries to life and who instead understood that 
 Behind those struggles there was a condition of profound injustice, 
 inequality, of deep attack on rights. 

 Then the judiciary is also influenced by strength relationships.
it concerns the condition of workers, workers, women, of 
 young, they are not good, there is a defense condition, even when there are 
 struggles we are unable to tear effective result nor can we conquer 
 Positions of strength compared to the government, the state. 

 So the problem of how to continue, how to prevent Alfredo from continuing to 
 stay in 41bis or even worse, how we can prevent there for others 
 companions this white torture, for our part it is a question of being tenacious for 
 extend this battle, to snatch concrete results and call everyone 
 to put our face on it, put our hearts, put our heads, but in the same 
 time we have to change the strength relationships. 

 We want to bring the condition of political prisoners to the workers, to 
 factories, and I can tell you that when we did it a few years ago for the 
 torture to some brigatists, then made also by burning cigarettes on 
 body, one for everyone, Cesare Di Lenardo, the workers were heard us, 
 interested, solidarity. We led him to the workers of Ilva di Taranto 
 And we said it was a question that touched them too. 

 Even now we are starting to bring the story of the fact to the factory, 
 Telling to the workers: look that they are talking about you, so you have to deal with 
 Of this, it's up to you. 

 We are talking that the application of 41bis is also a violation of the 
 Constitution, but the government is speaking these days of changing, 
 upset the Constitution, Meloni said he wants to introduce the 
 presidentialism or semi presidentialism, and in the near future certainly 
 they will want to change the fundamental articles, those on anti -fascism, 
 anti -racism. We are denouncing that they violate their own laws, 
 The Constitution, but in the meantime they are changing it. 

 For example, what Nordio wants to do is very serious, but in the meantime he is 
 By doing, and you don't see that reaction against which it would be necessary. There 
 issue of telephone interceptions is serious, they want to remove it, 
 because they must guarantee them, to the corrupt politicians, to the fascists who have inside 
 Parliament and the main institutions, to legal criminality. These 
 they must not be controlled, wiretapping should only be made to the mafiosi 
 And to the "terrorists", then we are seeing what is meant by "terrorism" for 
 that you just need to throw a bowler back ... evidently we have a vocabulary 
 different. 

 So our problem, also to answer what to do, is to extend to 
 360 degrees the mobilization for Cosenza, from Democrats, to workers and to whom 
 He wants to make more incisive initiatives; At the same time start changing the 
 strength relationships, both now and especially for the future. 

 But to have strength relationships in our favor, in particular among the 
 workers, the important question is the unit of workers, without the unity 
 without an autonomous organization from the control and line of the union leaders 
 confederal, if there is no unit of the factories in the first place and then with all 
 social sectors that fight, want to fight, who have a condition 
 Heavy, it is difficult to change strength relationships. 

 We are already traveling this path, we are trying to improve the 
 strength relationships. We have convened a proletarian national assembly 
 anti -capitalist in Rome, in which the various struggles, especially of the workers, yes 
 they unite. I want to invite you to be there to this assembly. 

 If we begin to be many, to put ourselves together, with the debate, the 
 Discussion, combining the struggles, perhaps we can save many "Alfredo".

 ** Latin American Groups in Norway(LAG)Recently published a report above 
 The consequences Statkraft's renewable energy projects in Brazil have for nature, 
 The climate and locals. ** 

 In [report](https://www.latin-amerikagruppene.no/assets/images/Rapport-Ute-
av-syne-ute-av-sinn-redusert-st%C3%B8rrelse-til-nettsida1.pdf)have layers 
 examined how these projects, which create energy from renewable resources 
 As water, wind and sun have affected the environment, nature, indigenous peoples and farmers in the areas. 
 Chairman of the Board, Larissa Avelar, points out that renewable is not the same 
 as sustainable and that even if it is not released greenhouse gases, it has great 
 Consequences for the lives of people, the environment and nature. 

 Team writes that the resistance to the development of hydropower and wind power in Norway has 
 motivated Statkrafts to invest more abroad and that while the Norwegian state 
 Historically has valued public ownership of energy production, it contributes 
 to the privatization of the sector in Brazil. They write that it seems apparently 
 look like it's good for the people with great state ownership and with a large 
 proportion of renewable energy but even if we do not hear much about it in Norway it is 
 are there major conflicts around this in Brazil as well, and Brazilians are among the 
 in the world that has the most expensive electricity. 

 Statkraft tries to waive the responsibility of the destruction of most 
 their facilities were established by others from before and not it was those who stood for 
 Deforestation and forced people. The people were promised jobs, energy 
 and better economy, and Statkraft led to an important part of their projects 
 is to ensure that "the local community should be better than before they came". Most 
 The interview subjects in the survey tell that what they are left with is 
 the damage from the projects, while the resources and profits disappear out of 
 The region. 

 Statkraft has also said they should stay away from the rainforest in the Amazon, but 
 has at the same time purchased in facilities that have, among other things, built dams in 
 indigenous areas and large parts of the Atlantic rainforest in Rio Grande do 
 Sul. An indigenous leader says that they can no longer live as indigenous peoples, that they 
 forced to live in a world that is not theirs and is about to lose 
 its culture because of the destruction of Statkraft's plant Monjolinho. 

 Statkraft is wholly owned by the Norwegian state, and has power plants in 16 countries in Europe, 
 Asia, and in Latin America, where they also operate in Chile and Peru. They have 
 Operated in Brazil since 2009 and now has 18 power plants in the country. On the website say 
 they write that by 2025 they will expand the business in Brazil through 
 Procurement and participation in public auctions for new projects.

 In the various countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia._ 

 Statkraft is not the only Norwegian company that profits at the expense of 
 The people and nature of Brazil. A large number of Norwegian companies in finance, 
 Mining, fishing, agriculture, oil, gas, shipping, telecommunications, 
 Commodity production and energy do the same. According to a calculation made by Brazil- 
 expert Torkjell Leira, could 11 thousand Brazilian families bread for it 
 Norwegian companies take out profits in Brazil.

  ** Italy nuclear risk: the new bombs in Ghedi and Aviano ** 

 They are about to arrive from the United States also in Ghedi(Brescia)and Aviano(Pordenone)The nuclear bombs of "new generation" B61-12. They will replace the 
 Old B61-11 located for years in the military bases in Belgium, Germany, 
 Netherlands, Turkey and Italy as part of the so -called doctrine of 
 nuclear sharing, 

 NATO's "nuclear sharing". 

 They are called "tactical nuclear devices", but are no less dangerous than 
 "strategic nuclear bombs" present in the Arsenals of the United States, Russia, 
 China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. 

 The "adjustable power" of the new B61-12 varies from 0.3 to 50 kilotons, five 
 times higher than the Hiroshima bomb. But - they report peace and disarmament network e 
 ICAN campaign - they can explode under the earth's surface by increasing 
 Thus their destructive ability until they reach the equivalent of a weapon 
 bursting on the surface with a yield of 1,250 kilotons, that is about 83 bombs 
 Like the one used in Hiroshima. 

  ** Today Italy is a possible nuclear target ** 

 All this makes ** ghedi ** e ** aviano **, but also reflected ** Brescia ** e 
 ** Pordenone **, ** Possible target in the nuclear war **. An eventuality 
 Today no longer so remote: in recent months the Russian authorities have shown 
 The possibility of using tactical nuclear bombs in Ukraine. 

 In response, the administration of Joe Biden has decided to keep in 
 the possibility of using nuclear devices first, 
 thus renouncing to introduce the no First Use rule. Not only that: the rapid 
 change of the world scenario is also leading to the use 
 quote of nuclear weapons to defend what the American leaders and 
 Europeans define the "order -based order". 

 Nuclear bombs, even the "tactical" ones, can therefore no longer be 
 consider a tool of mere deterrence, but expose the populations of 
 territories in which they are stored to be targets of the "first shot" or of 
 Further retaliation.

 They have thus had some form of veto to other countries that have leopard, 
 Including Norway. Chancellor Scholtz yes means a number of countries will send these

 Faso same way as Mali: They throw French forces out of the country, and want 
 Russian forces from Wagner welcome. There have been many popular protests 
 where French flags have been burnt and Russian flags have been lifted up to 
 the sky. French imperialism is notoriously unpopular among the masses in the west- 
 Africa, and both Mali and Burkina Faso have been French colonies and are today 
 semi -colonies in which French and Russian imperialism rival with each other and 
 With Yankee imperialism and Chinese imperialism.

# Concrete work and work in abstract

Author: carga

Time: 2023-02-01T83:00:00

Head Description: Continuamos con la reproducción de estas notas, elaboradas por el camarada Eugenio Gastiazoro, director de nuestro semanario y miembro del Comité Central del PCR, fallecido recientemente. Las mercancías son objetos que sirven para satisfacer necesidades y, como tales, tienen un valor de uso. Pero, a su vez, son objetos que sirven para el cambio y, como tales, tienen un valor de cambio. A primera vista, el valor de cambio se presenta como una relación cuantitativa en que cambian los valores de uso y que se modifica constantemente según la época y el lugar. Pero no es así. Un artículo se cambia por una gran variedad de otros a la vez. El valor de cambio expresa algo que le es común. Si dejamos de lado sus valores de uso, las mercancías sólo tienen una propiedad común: la de ser producto del trabajo humano abstracto. Los siguientes extractos del tomo I de El Capital, la obra magna de Carlos Marx, se refieren al doble carácter del trabajo representado en las mercancías.

Description: We saw at the beginning that the merchandise had two faces: the use value and the exchange value. Then we saw that the work, being expressed in the value, no longer possessed the same characteristic features that distinguished it as a creator of use values. (…) The use value of each merchandise & Hellip;

![](Images/Marx-w-1.jpg)We saw at the beginning that the merchandise had two faces: the use value and the 
 of exchange value. Then we saw that the work, being expressed in the 
 value, no longer possessed the same characteristic features that distinguished it as 
 Creator of use values.(…)The use value of each merchandise contains useful work, that is, activity 
 productive of a certain type exercised with a purpose also 
 determined. Use values cannot enter into relation as merchandise 
 If they do not contain qualitatively different useful works. In a society 
 whose products generally take the form of goods, that is, in a 
 Society of merchandise producers, this qualitative difference between 
 various useful works done independently of each other, such as 
 own and exclusive activities of many other independent producers, 
 It develops until a complicated system, a social division of the 
 job.(…)All elements of material wealth not supplied directly by 
 Nature owes its existence to a specific productive activity, 
 exercised with a concrete purpose, an activity that seizes 
 particular materials of nature and put them at the service of 
 certain human needs. As creator of use values, work 
 It is a useful job, it is a necessary and independent condition of all 
 forms of society for the existence of the human race; it is a necessity 
 perennial, imposed by nature, without which there can be no 
 material exchange between man and nature or, therefore, life 
 human.(…)Man can only act as nature does, that is, changing the 
 form of matter. Moreover, in this work of modification of the form, counts 
 constantly with the collaboration of natural forces. We see, then, 
 Work is not the only source of material wealth, of use values 
 produced by work. As William Petty said, work is the father and 
 the earth the mother. 

 Let us now move from the merchandise considered as use value to the merchandise 
 considered as value.(…)*** 



 If we dispens with the special form of productive activity, that is, the 
 work utility, there is no more than the spending of human force of 
 job. The work of the tailor and the weaver represent activities 
 qualitatively different productive, but they have one thing in common: they are a 
 Productive expenditure of human brain, muscle and nervous energy, etc. In 
 This sense are human work. They are two different forms of 
 Application of man's work force. 

 Naturally, to be able to apply in this or that way it is necessary that the 
 Human work force reach a greater or lesser degree of development. Now 
 Well, in itself the value of merchandise only represents human work, 
 Human work expense, simply. In this sense, it occurs with work 
 human the same that happens with man in bourgeois society: as a man 
 It barely means anything; It is only quoted, it only plays an important role as 
 General, or as a banker. 

 Human work is the use of that simple work force that 
 He has every ordinary man, in general, in his body, without the need for 
 No special education. The simple average job changes, without a doubt, 
 character according to the countries and culture of each era. But it always exists in 
 a certain society. Complex work is nothing more than simple work 
 intensified or, rather, multiplied: a small amount of work 
 Complex can be equivalent to a lot of simple work. The 
 experience shows that this reduction from complex work to simple work 
 It is a phenomenon of every day, every hour. 

 A merchandise can be the product of a very complex work, but its value 
 I immediately equate the product of simple work and, as such value, only 
 It represents, therefore, a certain amount of simple work. The 
 various proportions in which different classes are reduced to the unit of 
 Simple work measure are established through a social process that 
 It operates behind producers. Therefore, they believe them established by 
 custom. For simplification reasons, we will consider, now in 
 ahead, the workforce, whatever, as a direct expression of the 
 simple workforce; Thus we will save the discomfort of having to 
 reduce it to unit.(…)In relation to the use value, the work represented by the merchandise only 
 Qualitatively account. Regarding the magnitude of the value only 
 counts quantitatively, once reduced to the pure human work unity 
 and simple. In the first case, it is the class and the quality of the 
 job; in the second of the quantity, of the duration.(…)The leveling of 
 The most different forms of work is only possible if we dispense with their
Human workforce, abstract human work.

![](Images/Julio_Antonio_Mella.jpg)What does it mean to be brief and concise? Not say a word more or less than 
 that is necessary and express each idea with the minimum of words. 

 Briefness is a fundamental virtue, because the newspaper of the proletarians 
 It is formed by a few sheets that must collect all the palpitations of the 
 World life that have interest for the working class. If you are not 
 Brief steals space, prevents other interesting news from being set 
 or more than yours. Not be concise, that is, write more than necessary, 
 It also constitutes a serious fault in a journalist. The weekly newspaper or 
 Diario is a conquest of modern life. And, at this time of great 
 industries, transatlantic flights in less than 40 hours, everyone who lives 
 Really, live something quickly. Therefore, if you, dear correspondent, 
 Write something more necessary, you will not get your work to be read 
 For all, what should be the aspiration of a good journalist. 



 **Unit** 

 How to be brief and concise, while expressing what is necessary? We are going to 
 Try to say how. 

 Each article, information or chronicle must have a single central idea. 

 This central idea must guide the writer throughout the development of the 
 job. You must take care that new "parasitic ideas" do not come to your 
 mind and are as fungi or other plants around a thick trunk. Thus 
 It will have won the conciseness. Nothing out of what is necessary to explain the idea 
 Central will take place. It is useful to recommend that the articles write two 
 times always. First, a draft. Once this is finished, it must be corrected 
 The following aspects, according to the above, to see if it is brief and 
 concise. Everything superfluous must be removed. A second review will be for 
 choose the terms and words well; It will be seen, first of all, if every word 
 Indicate what the writer had in mind. 

 A good way to do this work is to "forget" what is written and put in the 
 disposition of a reader who will know what we have written. That way 
 You can account for any correspondent of the effect you will cause in your 
 Readers written.

# The Chinese Revolution and the Environment

Head Description:

These experiences, and many others, had the & Hellip as a guiding principle;

![](Images/Chinese_Revolution_Posters-7-proteger-el-bosque-1970.jpg)** We saw in previous notes some of the experiences of the revolution 
 China ** headed by the Chinese communists led by Mao Tsetung, in 
 particular the battles starring the masses to solve problems 
 millennaries of droughts and floods, and the advanced experiences of the 
 popular communes. 

 These experiences, and many others, had as a guiding principle the 
 continuation of the revolution in socialist society, and the confrontation 
 Between two lines in the party and in the state, the followers of the road 
 capitalist, and the revolutionaries. 

 All this had its correlation in the defense of the environment, with successes and 
 Errors as Chinese communists themselves recognized. While there was no talk 
 In these terms, as spread in the West from the 1970s, 
 And the term ecology was used, the Chinese revolutionaries showed 
 Since the beginning in the areas that were releasing, and then in the set of 
 China, a great concern for forest preservation, small 
 Hydroelectric dams that revolutionized the obtaining of energy in the 
 rural zones, 

 It was important in this sense the use of organic fertilizer over the 
 chemical compounds, and the diffusion of biogas(combustible obtenido de
desechos orgánicos), which allowed progress in reforestation in vast areas 
 rural, and give the battle against indiscriminate felling of trees, used 
 By millennia for the peasants to obtain firewood. 

 In cities, in full cultural revolution, that gigantic process of struggle 
 For power in the conditions of a dictatorship of the proletariat, the 
 Maoist, while displaying the political and ideological struggle so that 
 The masses will effectively take the direction of the levers 
 State keys, campaigning to “strive to collect the 
 scrap and other waste. ” 

 All this today has disappeared, since from the tragedy of the 
 capitalist restoration in China from 1978 and the voracious development of 
 an imperialist bourgeoisie that undergoes the Chinese people and seeks its expansion 
 Throughout the planet, environmental problems and pollution have 
 Multiplied greatly. 



 ** The fight against the "four pests" ** 

 Towards the end of the 1950s, in 1957 the president of China Mao Tsetung 
 promoted the campaign against "the four pests"(mosquitos, moscas, ratas y
gorriones)as one of the paths to promote hygiene and care of 
 The crops. He did it in the midst of the campaign for the "great leap forward" of 
 The economy and socialist society, which has been the subject of the most absurd 
 defamations by the imperialist powers and their scribes 
 academics, who speak of a famine of millions. 

 Launched the campaign mobilizing the masses, the Chinese verified that the 
 Extermination of sparrows had been a mistake, because not only the 
 grain seeds, but a great variety of insects that affected the 
 Plantations. 

 In 1960, the Socialist State and Mao himself recognized this error, and 
 They raised to change the extermination of sparrows, which were reintroduced into 
 China, for bed bugs. 

 Learning from mistakes, Chinese Maoist, with Mao at the head, 
 The popular communes were promoted since the beginning of the 60s, and then 
 They launched the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, as the program raises 
 of the PCR: “It was a great revolution starring millions of men and 
 Women, youth and older, workers, peasants, students, etc. that a 
 From 1966 they moved that country and the world. With her it was possible to prevent the 
 capitalist restoration and sustain the dictatorship of the proletariat for more 
 ten years old, taking it to its most advanced point. ” 



 ** China at the First International Conference on the Environment ** 

 In 1972 the first United Nations conference was held on the 
 Human medium in Sweden. This went down in history as the first conference of 
 The UN on the environment. There, in an international context in which 
 There were two superpowers(EEUU y la Unión Soviética ya transformada en
socialimperialismo), several debates were given. Among them, about the use of 
 nuclear weapons. In front of a statement proposal that "recommended" to leave 
 On the side, essays with nuclear weapons in general, the delegation of the 
 People's Republic of China raised, without hypocrisy, that “the superpowers 
 They continued the armament career and that China had to carry out rehearsals of 
 weapons for your own defense, but that, contrary to superpowers, 
 He had promised not to be the first to use nuclear weapons ”and 
 “He insisted that the draft declaration had failed to specify the cause 
 main of the contamination of the environment, namely, the pillage policy, 
 aggression and war 

 that the imperialist, colonialist and neo -colonialist countries practiced,
And the Chinese representatives with a statement proposal, which 
 He lost the vote, which said: “In order to protect humanity and 
 Human medium, it is essential to prohibit the use of weapons sharply 
 inhuman biological and chemicals that seriously contaminate and harm the 
 medium, and proceed to its complete destruction; prohibit and destroy 

 completely nuclear weapons and, as the first measure for this, to achieve 
 that the states that have nuclear weapons reach an agreement of no 
 use of them at any time and under any circumstances ”(Informe de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas Sobre el Medio Humano,
Estocolmo, 5 a 16 de junio de 1972. Naciones Unidas, Nueva York, 1973). 



 ** Standards for Environmental Protection ** 

 Also in 1972, in the middle of the proletarian cultural revolution in China, the 
 Then China Prime Minister, Zhou enlai(Chou En - Lai), great defender 
 of environmental protection with a revolutionary perspective, 
 promoted some political criteria that were discussed throughout the country, 
 In addition to motorizing a national conference on environmental protection that 
 It was carried out in 1973, and a specific State Council that promoted the 
 creation of government management institutions, both for 
 study problems to control industry pollution, 
 cities and hydraulic resources. 

 Chinese revolutionaries sought to resolve the contradiction between the 
 development of agricultural and industrial production, to guarantee 
 Independence of the people and the nation, and the protection of the environment, thus 
 as the contradiction between immediate results and interests to 
 medium and long term. 

 On this basis, they established rules around planning trying 
 of compatible relationships between industry and agriculture, 
 urban and rural areas, production and human life, development 
 economic and the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the ecosystem. 

 With the experience in the fight to dominate the "harmful" rivers, and 
 generalizing to other areas the resolution of the “dialectic between water and 
 soil, ”they said that the pollution and destruction of the environment are due to the 
 exploitation and irrational use of natural resources and 
 Energy. 

 To advance this fight, the central was the confidence in the masses and their 
 initiatives, both in the protection of the environment, in the fulfillment of 
 Laws and regulations linked to these issues. 

 A concrete fight that occurred in the midst of the development of the communes 
 popular, with the examples of the commune of Tachai in agriculture and that of 
 Taching(producción petrolera)In the industry, it was the theme of the 
 contradiction between cities and rural areas. 

 This fight to solve one of the fundamental contradictions of the 
 Society divided into classes had concrete roads in revolutionary China, 
 that went through promoting small and medium cities discouraging the 
 large, surround industrial centers, as well as promote 
 industries in rural areas. 

 The restoration of capitalism in China in 1978, which closed a stage in the 
 development of the revolutionary movement of the world proletariat, swept 
 a process with the great conquests achieved with the revolution, and in 
 concrete as regards environmental pollution and climate change, 
 China is today one of the main imperialist powers responsible for 
 the dire consequences of the capitalist exploitation system and 
 Imperialist, first of all about their own population, and above all 
 Peoples of the world.

Description: Based on the streets, the claim of unity to defeat macrismo at the polls was growing in the popular masses.

![](Images/marcha-24-de-marzo.jpg)** Departure from the streets, the claim of 
 Unity to defeat macrismo at the polls. That popular claim led to the 
 Constitution of the front of all, with the participation of 17 games 
 politicians, including the PCR-PTP. This was a great success of our CC, which 
 allowed us to travel a period of political unity with the Peronist masses 
 and its leaders, which is still ongoing. ** 

 The 2019 elections showed the importance of the Personerías again 
 of the work and town party, in each province, not only because they are 
 A demand for the electoral system, but is also a tool for 
 The political struggle in the masses. 

 In the primary of August 2019, the FDT beat Macri for 15 points of 
 Difference, this generated great joy. Macrismo won the streets in the 
 “30 days - 30 cities” campaign carried out a brutal devaluation of the 
 Weight, announced by National Chain, stating that “the world no longer trusts 
 us". At the same time the direction of the FDT calls "not to make waves", 
 ironing the electoral campaign. All this allowed to reduce the difference from 
 15 points from the step to 8 points in the general elections. 

 So deep was the hatred of the Argentine people to macrismo that, despite the 
 loan of 44,500 million dollars that Trump made, then 
 President of the United States, and the IMF, could not prevent defeat 
 electoral. That money went to a fraudulent financial bicycle and neither 
 A single dollar came to the town. 

 Before delivering the government, on December 7, 2019, the macrismo made 
 An act to say goodbye to the government by filling the Plaza Mayo. It was a demonstration 
 of forces, where it was clear that they were not willing to resign power and 
 that they were going to consolidate a right -wing opposition pole, also disputing the 
 street. 



 ** A new political scenario ** 

 The triumph in the first round of the front of all in the elections of 27 of 
 October 2019, with the formula Alberto Fernández President and Cristina 
 Kirchner Vice President, generated expectations in popular masses, about 
 All in the Peronist masses. 

 On November 11, 2019, a coupled coup d'etat occurred in Bolivia 
 in the US, against the government of Evo Morales. Before assuming, it was decisive 
 Alberto Fernández's intervention, along with López Obrador(presidente de
México)To save the life of Evo Morales, who as of December 10 
 He was received in Argentina as a political refugee. 

 Among the first measures were the creation of the Ministry of Women, 
 Gender and diversity and the restoration of the Ministry of Health and 
 Work, from the popular struggle. Also among the first measures 
 There was the suspension of retirement mobility, negative aspect. 

 Although elected legislators were mostly representatives of the 
 Kirchnerism also entered as deputies the comrade of the PCR-PTP and 
 national coordinator of the CCC, Juan Carlos Alderete, by Buenos Aires, and the 
 Comrade Lía Caliva, by Salta. In the Chaco, the provincial deputy was elected 
 Comrade of the PCR-PTP Rodolfo Schwartz, and three communist councilors 
 Revolutionaries of the Qom community. And they were elected communist councilors 
 Revolutionaries and companions of the CCC in several locations. 
 Some and some representatives from other organizations also entered 
 popular 

 Everyone's front was born as the need for the working class and the people to 
 Electorally defeat the Macri government. The great popular masses no 
 They wanted to continue living in Macrista Hell. 

 We said in our report of the Central Committee of January 2020: “If we fight 
 because the crisis is paid by those who filled the pockets we cannot 
 leave the streets and stay waiting. The defeat of macrismo in the 
 streets and at the polls, and the triumph of everyone's front creates better 
 Conditions to fight to solve, first, emergencies […] 
 Our practice of every day we have different pressures. We start from 
 the basis that in the decisions made by the new government, we do not have 
 Participation or consulted. […] We are still part of the 
 Front of all. We do not put the new government in the target, but we say and 
 We argue what we do not agree. […] And we reaffirm that we start from no 
 leave the streets and put the center of our actions in the fight for 
 Solve emergencies.(Informe del CC del PCR, 4 y 5 de enero del 2020). 

 The PCR/PTP in the front of all we hit macrismo and its partners. It 
 We do political independence, disputing the political leadership of the 
 masses for our line of accumulation of revolutionary forces, so that 
 The PCR is known and recognized by those masses. 



 ** The Government of the Front of All and Alberto Fernández ** 

 Alberto Fernández's government assumed in a very difficult situation and
We from the beginning reaffirm that we continued directing the blow 
 main of the popular struggle to the sector that politically expresses macrismo, 
 which hegemonizes the block of the ruling classes. A sector of 
 landowners, monopolies of agribusiness and exporters of grains, the 
 mining, oil, the main branches of industry, banks and 
 financial organizations, etc., which are mainly held in the 
 Yankee and English imperialism, and are the most recalcitrant sector and more 
 Dangerous for the working class, the people and the Argentine nation. 

 We also propose in the January 2020 report, which in the front of all 
 We did not join popular sectors, but we also hit together 
 With sectors of the ruling classes, which fought to recover hegemony 
 and with those who agreed on the need to defeat Macri. 

 The intermediary bourgeoisie sector expressed by President Alberto 
 Fernández is a supporter of the diversification of the agency(buenas
relaciones con todos los imperialismos)And it is mainly at 
 Imperialisms of Europe. During the government of Nestor Kirchner he played his 
 side. With Cristina Kirchner she broke in 2008, and met in 2019 when, to 
 Return from a trip to Cuba, he appointed him as a candidate for president 
 aware that this unit was necessary to succeed. 

 The intermediary bourgeoisie sector expressed by Cristina Kirchner arrived at 
 Government in 2003 and ruled for 12 years; It was hegemonic, in alliance with 
 Other sectors, among the ruling classes until the triumph of Macri in 2015. 
 Directs important sectors of Peronism, where it expresses a real current and 
 It lies mainly in Chinese and Russian imperialisms. 

 Together with these two sectors, which hegemonizes the government, there are other sectors of 
 intermediary bourgeoisie and provincial bourgeoisies, as minor partners in the 
 government. There is also the intermediary bourgeoisie sector that represents 
 Sergio Massa, and who has gained positions in the government. 

 For treatment we start from politics, always taking into account that 
 These are an important part of Peronism, where they direct currents that 
 express national bourgeoisie sectors, patriotic sectors, leaders and 
 Popular and national union currents. And above all that are the 
 Direction of important sectors of the Peronist masses with which we fight 
 Unite on a revolutionary path.

![](Images/gran-bretaña-huelga-trabajadores-de-la-salud-enero-2023.jpg)** When inflation reaches historical records in the region **(y en el mundo
entero), workers in Europe are determined that their salaries are not 
 The adjustment variable. In France the demonstrations against reform 
 pension are historical. In Spain, health personnel are starring in 
 Important struggles. And in Britain the struggles do not stop and are more and more 
 the unions that call strikes. The conservative government cannot contain 
 The fight and wants to draw a law that removes the right to strike, disguised as 
 "Guarantee of minimal services." It was already approved in the Chamber of Deputies. 

 In the United Kingdom, 2023 began with historic strike days 
 Railways, with national strikes up to 5 days. Inflation 
 It reaches historical levels, with greater index in food, fuel, 
 services and rentals. In many cases, there are sectors that had no increases 
 salary in ... 10 years!

 Following the example of rail workers, nurses, 
 paramedics, border forces and mail workers 
 They also joined and organized from below unemployment days. Also 
 They called for bus drivers, luggage manipulators in 
 Airports, postal workers and Amazon workers. The media 
 journalistic consider that this is the largest movement of strikes from 
 the ultra conservative government of the pirate Margaret Thatcher. 

 For example, health services were paralyzed in health. Only 
 emergency services operated where patients treated 
 Chemotherapy, dialysis and intensive care, during January 18 and 19. Is 
 It is important to highlight that the strikes that began last year in this sector, 
 They were first approved in 106 years by the Nursing College. 
 The ambulance drivers also called unemployment. 

 On the other hand, 70,000 workers from 150 British universities called 
 Strike for 18 days between February and March. 

 In that increasing framework of struggles, the government declared that it will not allow 
 salary increases that match or exceed inflation. The unions are not 
 They are left behind in this fight, and declared “we have so many people on strike and 
 so many people suffering that only the government can change it, or a change of 
 Government(…)We are in this long term. ” 

 To stop the wave of strikes, the British government seeks to approve a new 
 Law that gives the police to suppress the most "disruptive" protests 
 and expands the legal definition of "severe disturbance." And wanting to advance more 
 Even, on Tuesday, January 17, a 
 Rishi Sunak Conservative Premier Project, which promotes the implementation of 
 "minimum services". This law goes against the right to strike, since if a 
 worker is notified as "essential" and declares himself on strike, he can 
 dismiss for breach of contract. 

 It is important to note that the people fight more force in front of a government 
 weak that intends to strengthen. During the last year the English had 
 Three changes of governments by different scandals. They are still scheduled 
 strike days by sectors throughout February.

# World economy perspectives

Time: 2023-02-01T90:00:00

Head Description: Según el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), la economía mundial creció un 6,0% en el año 2021, recuperándose de la caída de 3,0% acontecida en 2020 en el marco de la irrupción de la pandemia y las correspondientes medidas de confinamiento. No obstante, el año pasado la actividad global ha experimentado una significativa desaceleración hasta un crecimiento estimado en torno al 3,0%. Para este año, el FMI y el Banco Mundial, entre otros, advierten que se intensificará la desaceleración de la economía global, con una elevada probabilidad de recesión en Estados Unidos (EEUU), y en gran parte de Europa.

![](Images/proyecciones-economía-mundial-FMI-2023.jpg)** The increase in the price of energy caused by aggression ** 
 Imperialist from Russia to Ukraine, which mainly affected Europe, 
 Restrictions on mobility in China against COVID and monetary policy 
 Contractive in Europe and, mainly, in the USA in front of the inflationary jump 
 have contributed to the cooling of the economy in those countries and at the level 
 global. 

 The year 2022 has been marked by a general increase in inflation to 
 global scale, with increases above 8% in the price index to the 
 US consumer(8,1%), at the euro area(8,3%)and the United Kingdom(9,1%), all right 
 above the long -term goals of 2.0% of their respective banks 
 Central The barbaric aggression of Russian imperialism to Ukraine caused a 
 strong rises in the price of oil and gas, as well as a new jump in the 
 quotation of the grains, contributing decidedly to the increase in the 
 world inflation. However, in the last months of 2022 they have been reduced 
 oil prices and - even more - of gas, contributing to moderate 
 Inflationary pressures in Europe and worldwide. Remember that even 
 2021 The large majority of countries recorded years of very low inflation, 
 Except for some aberrant cases such as Argentina 

 To deal with inflation(siguiendo las recetas de política económica
burguesas), most G-20 countries have carried out the cycle of 
 more intense contractive monetary policy in decades, with strong increases in 
 Interest rates(desde valores cercanos o iguales a 0%)and withdrawing 
 market liquidity(en oposición a las políticas de “expansión
cuantitativa”). In the US, the current contractive cycle is the fastest and 
 forceful of the last forty years, according to the Central Bank of the 
 Argentinian republic. 

 Interest rates are contributed to "cooling" the activity 
 economic, by more expensive credit and consumption, at the same time 
 that the load of existing debts turns heavier; In particular, 
 rates paid by dependent countries for their heavy external debts. In 
 This framework continued to invest the performance curves of the bonds 
 Treasury in the US(bonos de largo plazo con tasas de interés inferiores a los
de corto), differential that usually anticipates a recession in the northern country. 

 In early January, the director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that 
 A third of the global economy would be in recession in 2023, including half 
 of the European Union. He also said that “this year will be much harder than the 
 that we leave behind ”, since the three main economies -United States, 
 China and the European Union- are slowing down simultaneously. Further 
 Recently, in the Davos forum, he ruled out the possibility of a recession 
 Global for this year(como en 2009 o 2020, cuando cayó el PIB mundial), it 
 which does not reduce the seriousness of the situation anyway. 

 In its October 2022 report, the IMF predicted a growth of 2.7% 
 for this year. For its part, in January the World Bank cut its forecast to 
 only 1.7%(desde el 3,0% proyectado en junio de 2022). He also warned that 
 “Given the fragile economic situation, any new adverse event 
 -As a higher inflation than the one planned, abrupt increases in rates 
 of interest to contain it, the resurgence of the Covid pandemic or the 
 intensification of geopolitical tensions- could push the economy 
 World recession. It would be the first time in more than 80 years that occur 
 two world recessions in the same decade. ” About dependent countries -a 
 which bourgeois economists call “emerging and in the process of 
 Development ”- The World Bank recognizes that“ they face a period of 
 several years of slow growth driven by a heavy burden of debt and 
 scarce investments ", which" will aggravate the setbacks in terms of 
 education, health, poverty and infrastructure, which are already devastating, as well as 
 The growing demands derived from climate change. ” 

 The UN director, which last week also reviewed his 
 Global growth forecast by 2023 to 1.7%, highlighted the growing 
 Income inequality in the world, which continued to sharpen between 2019 and 
 2022. Oxfam International said that “the richness of billionaires has 
 increased at a disconcerting rhythm ”; Since 2020 63% of the new wealth 
 generated was captured by the richest 1% of the world's population, even more than 
 in the last decade(54%)And the richness of billionaires has grown up in 
 2.7 billion dollars per day. The World Bank admits that we could be 
 Faced with the greatest increase in global inequality since the Second War 
 world. 



 ** Perspectives of the main economies ** 

 In 2022, the Yankee economy fell in recession in the first half, and then
following six months, closing the year with an average increase of 2.1%(-2,8%
en 2020 y +5,9% en 2021). However, both the World Bank and Bloomberg(promedio de proyecciones de Bancos y Consultoras)They expect a rise of only 
 0.5% by 2023. Inflation, which had already begun to increase by 2021 in the 
 Post -pandemic economic recovery frame, the most was last year 
 elevated since 1981. However, it has been moderated in recent months(6,5% interanual en diciembre), trend that is expected to continue towards 
 forward. 

 In 2022, the Chinese economy grew by 3%, affected by the policy of 
 confinements against Covid, which caused a setback in the second 
 quarter; After recovering in the next three months, GDP returned to 
 stagnate in the fourth quarter, also due to problems in the sector 
 real estate(que representa una quinta parte de su economía). Except for the 
 year 2020, China's growth in 2022 has been the lowest since 1976. For 
 2023, the World Bank projects a growth of 4.3%(5,1% Bloomberg), under 
 the forecast of a lifting of mobility restrictions that 
 encourage consumption, but already far from the average rhythm of 7.7% they exhibited in 
 the second decade of 2000. unlike the main economies of the 
 Planet, inflation has remained low in that country(2,0% promedio en
2022). 

 Europe has been seriously affected by the energy crisis unleashed from 
 From the invasion of Russia to Ukraine, given the close dependence of Russian gas, 
 in particular, by Germany. Gas prices in Europe reached 
 Cut from 2021, since Russia cut its supply at less than 20% 
 Regarding that year. After an estimated growth of 3.3% in 2022, the area 
 Euro would have a null increase of GDP this year, according to Bloomberg and the bank 
 World. An inflation reduction is also expected. 

 Russia, bogged down in Ukraine thanks to the heroic resistance of this country, 
 He had an estimated fall around 3.0% in 2022 and would show a 
 Similar decrease in 2023, according to the different sources. Japan's GDP(tercera economía mundial), which decreased in the third quarter, closed 2022 
 with an average rise estimated at 1.3% and similar performance is projected to 
 this year. For the United Kingdom, which would have entered recession in the third 
 2022 quarter, Bloomberg projects a 0.9% GDP drop in 2023. 

 Consequently, clouds increase the world economy. The 
 strong current economic slowdown, with a high probability of 
 recession in the US and much of Europe, added to the economic problems that 
 They persist in China, threatens to lead to a new world economic crisis, 
 that always hits the dependent countries like ours. TO 
 In turn, this increases war factors, since history has shown 
 again and again that imperialist powers try to get out of the crisis 
 forcing new distributions of the markets and spheres of influence, in a 
 dispute that transcends the economic level and inevitably leads to conflicts 
 armed, both inter -imperialist wars and imperialist aggression against 
 The oppressed countries, such as the one carried out by Russia in Ukraine.

![](Images/perú-protests-enero-2023.jpg)** When Pedro Castillo won at the presidential ballotage of Peru **, 
 He opened a great debate because that was believed "impossible." It was a triumph against 
 the expectations of the right and of a part of the "progressivism" that had another 
 Primary candidate. 

 Electoral triumph considered "impossible" in a country where the right seemed 
 omnipotent. Peru was shown, together with Sebastián Piñera's Chile, like 
 The best triumphant examples of the policies of entertaining in struggle 
 against the foggy "populism." 

 No inflation, with a stable dollar, with a permanent increase in investments 
 foreigners and exports. And above all without popular struggles, 
 apparently. It was said that the left did not exist anymore, and so 
 It seemed, when an earlier ballotage was reached among the murderer Keiko 
 Fujimori and the ultra reactionary Vargas Llosa. 

 But Castillo won. The impossible. 

 The presidency was as it was. All the sensible ones thought that Castillo was going to 
 Fall very soon, like a ripe fruit for a series of brave arguments: 
 He had been elected candidate because there was no possibility to win, 
 they were saying. 

 It did not have an organic and solid political force. His party, Peru Libre, 
 He divided immediately by the disputes over the cabinet. With minority in the 
 Congress, in the two Supreme Courts, on the FFAA. Without a diary or a radio 
 of province in his favor. Looked with contempt on the projequi right and with 
 quite indifference of Latin American progressivism. 

 Many of his relatives even part of the family abandoned him. Was a 
 "Indian," without experience. With antipheminist features. Initially, next to 
 Fair measures made innumerable concessions to his campaign program. 
 He gave the conservatives the Ministry of Economy. 

 And the most serious, did not call and organized the people to defend the positive, as 
 main measure of self -defense. To earn the sympathy of the military, 
 allowed the ashes of Abimael Guzmán to be thrown into the sea and reinforced 
 The brutal conditions of his partner's prison. 

 But the right with his fine class smell, tried one hundred provocations from 
 on the same day of the assumption. Corruption!It was the war cry. In a Peru 
 where of the last 10 presidents, one committed suicide when they were going to stop(Alan García), another is imprisoned(Fujimori), two on bail and three 
 processed The only unprocessed one was 5 days in exercise. 

 Finally, the self -fulfilled prophecy happened. With the betrayal of their most 
 intimate collaborators. 

 When, already cornered, and before they dismissed it, tried to use the 
 Constitution that allowed him to dissolve Congress, an army statement 
 and of the National Police of Peru notifying that they would not comply with their orders, 
 consumed the military and institutional coup. Immediate recognition of the 
 American ambassador, who assumed in Peru after being 9 years director at the 
 INC. 

 But the impossible happened again. Instead of everything returned to the place of 
 Where he had never left, Peru burned. 

 The center is the area that goes from Ayacucho to Puno. It is the main region of the 
 Insurrection of Tupac Amaru, which extended to Alto Peru. There it passed 
 main of the 10 years of war of the people against the Spaniards. 

 There the main thing about the armed struggle of the Shining Path was carried out. 

 Since then years of peasant resistance. And battle against miners. 

 But also in that area and further north by the mountain range, are the new 
 Mining and Camisea Gas, and east is cocaine in the VRAEM(así
se denomina la zona especial de los valles de los ríos Apurímac, Ene y
Mantaro). 

 The brightness is in Lima, but true production, which matters 
 fundamentally to imperialisms and native reactionaries that oppress 
 Peru today are under fire. 



 **The actual situation** 

 Everyone speaks of the South, but the uprisings have spread to the north. 
 Where the great resistance to the Conga mining project and Cajamarca of 
 Where is a native Castillo. 

 And also to the east, towards the VRAEM, Mother of God, Amazonas. Where is it 
 the coca and the paved route that San Pablo joins in the Atlantic with Lima in the 
 Peaceful. 

 And the big surprise, the mass of the protest in Lima and in Arequipa(reservas políticas y electorales del fujimorismo y la derecha en general), 
 where for the first time in many years, the protest broke out in universities 
 and professional centers. Police ran over the National University of 
 San Marcos(todos los claustros exigen la renuncia de la rectora), but the 
 National University of Engineering(UNI)It is still a resistance center 
 With his rector to the head. 13 University Student Centers of Lima, the 
 Callao and Cusco demand the resignation of Boluarte 

 The front constituted on the bottom is very wide. The CGT of Peru, miners, 
 RONDEROS, graduates(veteranos de guerra), students, informal miners and
And women who play a very advanced role with their centers and federations. 

 The ruling classes are united to crush the uprisings, but 
 divided by making new elections this year or in 2024(Boluarte). They try to calm with that and see. In a discredit panorama 
 General of Parliament and political parties. 

 85% repudiate Congress and 71% to Boluarte. 

 It does not seem to be an easy task, queen alarm for the use of "hazelnuts", 
 Homemade artisanal miners, similar to the "puppy" of dynamite 
 of the Bolivians. 



 ** The Peruvian model. The Latin American model ** 

 What is Peru for imperialisms and ruling classes? 

 Fundamentally mining, is the second world copper producer, and now 
 They go for lithium and uranium. Gas and oil. 

 Cocaine. 80,000 hectares of coca cultivation. Displaced Colombia as the first 
 world producer and is the first cocaine exporter to the US. And a little more: 
 Tourism, organic food, etc. 

 For most of the 32 million people left over there is misery and 
 Hunger, subsistence agriculture, "commerce", etc. 

 The impossible is not rebellion. The heroic Peruvian people have shown that 
 impossible, the "utopian", the "fool" is to believe that this can be achieved by 
 Always without fighting, without resistance. With their advances and their setbacks. 



 **The fight** 

 The defense of the model unites all imperialisms, landowners and 
 Peruvian right. But divides them to death for the benefit of who is going to 
 consummate the dispossession. And that increases day by day in a world where 
 superpowers have to grow permanently not to disappear. Although 
 That leads the world to war. 

 The traditional domain of Yankee imperialism is being confronted 
 growing by voracious Chinese imperialism. 

 China is already today the main commercial partner of Peru. And it has a very 
 Advanced to consolidate this predominance through increasing investments 
 direct capital especially in the new mining and a brave letter: the 
 Chancay port. 

 A new overlap at 90 km north of Lima is in full construction that 
 It would displace the traditional port of El Callao. The owner company and 
 Constructora is made up of 60% by the Chinese company COFCO and 40% 
 by the Glencore company. We both know them in our ports. 

 There would be 50% of China's trade with Latin America that is already 
 580,000 million dollars annually. 

 Keep in mind that by the Panama Canal including the new 
 locks, only panamax ships can pass and paying nearby values 
 to a million dollars per freight. 

 In Chancay they could dock the super bulkters and super tanks, and the new 
 Portenero who cannot go through Panama. 

 And it should never be forgotten that by the ports of El Callao, Paita and the flights 
 Illegal, 80 % of cocaine leaves today, mainly to the US. All that 
 It would now go through Chancay. With a great fear of the ruling classes of 
 Chile, because it would move to San Antonio and Valparaíso. And to Guayaquil in 
 Ecuador. 

 But in addition, it was a generalized comment that these days signed 
 With Chinese companies a letter of intent to the construction of the 
 Pacific Railroad, Tumbes(frontera con Ecuador)a Tacna(frontera
con Chile). Railroad that could be joined with Puno and from there to Bolivia and 
 Argentina, in addition to the Arica La Paz railroad, or the jump- 
 Antofagasta, both operable today with some difficulties. 

 To account for the hurry of the coup you have to keep in mind that they expire this 
 year the main concessions of Fujimori, like here those of Menem. The Chinese 
 They are already in mining, they go for more, and the Yankees want to keep what 
 that have. 



 **The exit** 

 For the umpteenth time the peoples and reality determine to demonstrate that 
 In Latin America there is no easy, reformist exit. 

 You cannot respond to the minimum needs of the great masses without 
 Break even partially the dependent and reactionary model. But 
 The time, it is not possible to break that model even partially if I do not 
 unleashes and displays all the combative potential of the exploited and the 
 humiliated Of the huge masses of workers, peasants, native, women, 
 Students, small and medium -sized national entrepreneurs, etc. 

 To the brave Peruvian people he has to show again that sovereignty and 
 Social Justice are two faces of the same currency in a Latin America 
 subjected by imperialism and landowners. Without sovereignty you can't 
 make or reforms(como lo vemos todos los días en nuestro país), and without 
 Unleash the struggle for social justice cannot even dream of sovereignty. 

 It will be a new and exciting task for the working class and the Peruvian people 
 who knew how to have revolutionary leaders such as Mariátegui. 

 We have the total and selfless solidarity between two villages that
Latin Americans for freedom, independence and justice. 

 And our best contribution will be the advances in the revolutionary struggle of our 
 country.

![](Images/promotoras-de-salud-en-el-Congreso.jpg)Vanina, who is from the killing, begins telling us that “I integrate into 
 Health promoters process from pandemic, and I am some time ago 
 in the task of the National Coordination of Health Promoters. Starting 
 From fear of the virus, the issue of community health training came out 
 To prepare the companions, to have tools in front of this that it was 
 something new. Many of the companions already came with a health task, and the 
 Pandemia threw them to the prominence while in the front line with the pots 
 popular 

 “The promoters, unable to be on the street, we take as fighting measures 
 hold the pots against hunger, train us in prevention, and give it 
 Fight to that right that denied the virus. We met different 
 health problems, and turning what learned in the territory. They left 
 Armando sanitary posts, crisis committees, articulating with the rooms and 
 Health centers of each place, to fight an integrated type of health. 

 “Situations in the country were different. The common thing is that we needed 
 training, and we do different. A community training in 
 Health, which we did with the University of Avellaneda, also with the 
 Pan American Health Organization and based on all that effort in Pandemia 
 recognition was obtained within the Casa Rosada for the work of the 
 companions and how they played on the vaccination issue, 

 “The work that was armed throughout the country leaves us a path traveled where 
 We now come with a lot of achievements, such as that, from having taken the 
 health in their hands, begin to discuss the role of promoters within 
 hospitals and health rooms. 

 “In several areas we have won that companions can move to a permanent plant. 
 We have participated in the presentation of the Law Sanitary Agents and Promoters 
 of health, that we understand that they are two different instances that we think 
 They are integrated into public health. 

 “Health promoters are partners who train to prevent and 
 raise awareness, address social problems, detect a disease, 
 accompany. And health agents are companions 
 that they know how to put injections, take pressure and some that are already 
 vaccinating. 

 “The law that was presented is also important because in addition to recognition 
 that has been achieved in some places, we are fighting that the companions 
 are paid, as part of the health system. 

 “We participate in a national health meeting in Entre Ríos, with companions 
 De La Plata, Mar del Plata, Rosario and other places. It was fundamental for 
 know the discussions between doctors and other professionals from 
 Health, where we propose the importance of our role in the system 
 sanitary". 



 ** Health is a very serious problem in the economic time that we are ** 

 We ask Vanina where the promoters of 
 Health, and told us: “Health is a very serious problem in economic time 
 that we are, because one suffers one larger and we are very 
 Focused more than anything in the fight for law. 

 “Now we go to a national meeting of health promoters of the CCC, 
 which was resolved at the National Movement Table. There we expect power 
 share all the experiences of these years and be able to discuss the issues 
 policies from health, and how the political health influences. And from there 
 Be able to define our objectives together. Because there are different situations 
 in each neighborhood or each province. For example in Rosario and Misiones there are 
 Companions who passed to the permanent plant, in La Plata the companions are 
 Very articulated with the Faculty of Medicine of La Plata, with the municipality. In 
 Some places are more dedicated to the gender issue, in others to consumption 
 problematic, food theme, different situations ”. 

 Vanina also told us that the work of the presentation of the law 
 It promoted together with the Cayetans and other social organizations that 
 They work in health. "Particularly we raise the problems of 
 The neighborhoods, which is where we are. The bill is wide, because it covers 
 to health agents and health promoters, of which we have a 
 Mug, and not only in social organizations. ” 

 Another issue that our interviewee raises us is to address situations

 city with 77,000 people with unemployment problem and in a province that 
 Bate records with more than 400 crimes in 2022. The advanced drug trafficking, 
 situations of violence and intimidation with notorious impunity and without 
 Clear responses from the provincial and municipal government are current currency. A 
 This adds a context of persecution and criminalization to organizations 
 of the people and their referents, where the reactionary right is emboldened in 
 His offensive against popular organizations and political leaders for

 I appreciate everyone's support and solidarity. This does not have to be unpunished
arrive to silence those who are thoroughly in the fight to transform this 
 such unequal reality and that it hurts so much ». Thus, to the date of the date 
 We continue mobilized, since we have no clear answers and explanations for 
 part of the State and justice. However, we are convinced that it is 
 necessary the unity and prominence of everyone to demand justice and 
 speed in research, as well as to end impunity 
 and the inequality to which we want to get used to us so much.

 We share Tucumán PTP-PCR statement. 

 From the PTP - PCR we sympathize with the Peruvian people in its fair struggle 
 for their rights and dignity, as well as we express a total repudiation of 
 Repressive government. 

 Deep Peru has aroused, as Evo Morales said, claiming justice, 
 democracy and recovery of its natural resources. Before these orders, the 
 Representatives of the oligarchy repress brutally. 

 This struggle of the Peruvian people moves our Latin America, which is being 
 crossed by the dispute of imperialisms to continue the looting of 
 their natural resources and appealing to these puppets, which before the claims of the 
 People, do not hesitate to repress. 

 But the fight of the liberation of peoples, as history indicates, 
 Follow and develop until the triumph is crowning. That is why we want to remember the 
 Liberator of Latin America, José de San Martín, and the War of 
 Recovery of our Malvinas, as symbols of the union with the people 
 Peruvian. 

 A huge greeting and our solidarity, until victory always.

# Imperialist powers predate our seas

Head Description: 

Description: Year after year, hundreds of Chinese, Spanish, British, Korean, Taiwanese, etc., predate our sea, appropriating more than one million tons of “migratory species originating from the ZEE (Argentine exclusive economic zone)”.

![](Images/Pesca-ilegal.jpg)** Year, hundreds of Chinese, Spanish, British, Korean ships, Koreans, 
 Taiwanese **, etc., predate our sea, appropriating more than one million 
 tons of “migratory species originating from the ZEE(Zona Económica
Exclusiva Argentina)” Cesar Augusto Lerena, specialist in the subject, adds 
 That the amount of this illegal fishing has “a FOB value of 4,320 million US $ 
 and of 24,000 million US $ in the final market(Mercado Central de Valencia,
11/22), to which 325,000 tons of fishery resources are added 
 they extract annually in the Malvinas area with British illegal licenses, 
 For a value of 1.5 billion US $ fob that, in the final trade, 
 They transform into about 9 billion per year. ” 

 A few days ago, on January 10, Infobae.com published a report on fishing 
 illegal of hundred Chinese ships on the edge of the exclusive economic zone of 
 Our country, in the so -called "Mile 201". They come for squid, hake and 
 Other valuable species. Strikingly, the note does not dedicate a line to the 
 British colonialist occupation in our Falkland Islands, Georgias and 
 South Sandwich, from which the governments of the United Kingdom grant 
 Fishing licenses in the South Atlantic, including the Antarctic sector to ships 
 of different nationalities, especially Spanish. 

 Lerena affirms, in several articles published by the Institute of Studies 
 Nationals of the patriotic and popular forum, that “the devastating effects of the 
 Illegal fishing and the capture of migratory resources from the 
 Exclusive economic zone(ZEE), by foreign ships that, form 
 subsidized, fish in the Argentine Southwestern Atlantic. And, in fishing 
 Illegal are not only economic, biological, environmental and social damages, 
 but these practices cause violations in slave labor and 
 drug trafficking, in addition to impairing the sovereignty of riverside states. ” 

 The dispute around the construction of a “multipurpose” port in Rio 
 Grande, Tierra del Fuego, agreed with the Fueguino government and the company 
 Chinese state Shaanxi Chemical Industry Group, shows another aspect of progress 
 of this imperialist power about our sovereignty, and has points of 
 Contact with the favor of illegal fishing. The Minister of Production and 
 Environment of that province, Sonia Elizabeth Castiglioni, said in November 
 past that this “multipurpose port is thus raised because the quantity 
 of services that can give a port in these latitudes to the entire Atlantic 
 South is important and will position Argentina. Regarding the 201 mile I 
 I see how a work opportunity in the territories: today Malvinas, Punta 
 Arenas and Uruguay offer services and we see it pass ”(www.escenariomundial.com). 

 From the national government they have already expressed their opposition to construction 
 From this port, which according to Minister Fueguina would be “an investment of 210 
 million dollars from the Argentine firm Mirgor Sacifia, whose main 
 Shareholder is the businessman Nicolás Caputo. ” 



 ** illegal fishing ** 

 Lerena says, in another article in which he analyzes the Convention of Nations 
 Together with the law of the sea(Convemar), of which Argentina is 
 Signatory: “It is understood as illegal fishing, and with Indnr's technicalism(ilegal, no declarada, no registrada)to that which is done by violating 
 national, regional and/or international laws; when they are not declared or 
 It is made in an inaccurate way, operations; When there is no control of 
 captures and/or landing, because it is done without observers and inspectors 
 unleashed or transfers are carried out in the sea; the one that receives 
 subsidies of the state of origin, facilitating this type of fishing; the fishing of 
 Youth or unauthorized sizes; When using nets with meshes 
 lower than those approved for the species in question; When they are discarded 
 fish to the sea, because it is incidental or non -commercial fishing; when 
 They replace the species or falsify the statements; the one that overexploot 
 the available stocks or there is no way to determine it; the use of flags of 
 convenience to evade controls and penalties; The one that is not known 
 origin nor the traceability of the products; which is done without control of 
 good fishing practices; When appropriate for third parties 
 countries and/or are affected by developing regions or that in their economies have in 
 This resource an important means of livelihood; The one that causes pollution 
 Marine; which is done with slave labor or other irregularities 
 Environmental, ecological, social and economic. ” 

 And the specialist adds “77% of those fish are ships that come from 
 China, Japan, the European Union(España), South Korea, Taiwan, Great Britain and 
 Russia, and, all of them, they protect themselves in this convention that protects them and that, 
 In addition to appropriating - in most cases - of migratory resources
annual subsidies, an amount equivalent to 35% of the world market and, where 
 84% of these subsidies are destined for large fishing companies 
 that have freezing and processor ships, capable of moving to 
 long distances. A very high amount that exceeds that of all exports 
 Fisheries in Latin America. 

 “Fishing ships do not pretend autonomously. They are the countries that 
 They subsidize and promote illegal fishing and convey, reserve the 
 countries of origin of these ships the criminal sanction, which does not make ”. 

 The continuous predation of the maritime species that occurs in our sea is 
 part of the imperialist action that loots our resources, and occurs in the middle 
 of the resolution of the dispute by the South Atlantic, in these times that 
 The war drums of the main powers resonate strongly, which 
 They seek to reinforce their war devices worldwide, and also in the 
 South Atlantic and Antarctica. National Government concessions, and 
 provincial governments, in favor of one or another power only exacerbate that 
 Dispute, and go against a sovereign policy about our resources. 

 As we have said repeatedly, there is no sovereign policy in our seas 
 Without the complaint of the Madrid agreements signed by the Menemist government 
 With Great Britain, and without advancing, as proposed by the ten measures of our PCR 
 In a “new fishing law that protects work, resource and sovereignty 
 About our National Caladero. Renewal of the Fisheries Fleet and Promotion 
 of the naval industry. All ground fish for manufacturing for 
 Generate jobs. Zero discarding law that reinforces the fight against 
 hunger".

![](Images/comunidades-mapuches-mendoza-1.jpg)Last week the National Government delivered 21 thousand hectares to the communities 
 Mapuches in southern Mendoza. The measure was held in a deep study of 
 the original families that had long claimed the 
 recognition of their ancestral lands. 

 Cornejo, who has the ability not to be confused in the defense of 
 oligarchic interests, questioned the measure, silver that “harmed south 
 from the province". On the one hand, not only denies the historical rights of 
 Original communities, but has promoted their eviction. For 
 Another part, Cornejo is altered when lands are delivered to the peoples 
 native, but it seems extremely "normal", that land is delivered to the 
 great foreign and private corporations, as happened with the 12 thousand have 
 who gave up to the private group in Malargüe for a tourist entrepreneurship, 
 or the support and collaboration of Macri's attempt to deliver land in the 
 Traces that belong to the army for private ventures. 

 It is clear that as a faithful representative of the oligarchy and capitals 
 External, Cornejo is a retrograde that has the ability to never make a mistake 
 of side. They are samples of the policies that defends and the sectors to the 
 that benefits. 

 In a province where 5% of the owners have 93% of the land, 
 The right to land to live and work is a fundamental fight. The 
 Fight for Earth is a fight not only of the original communities, but 
 of the thousands of producers who do not access it and the hundreds of 
 thousands of families who find deep obstacles to have a 
 Lot to realize the dream of your own house.

![](Images/pintada-por-Perú-en-Quilmes-Berazategui-Varela.jpg)** 1. ** ** Long live the rebellion of the Peruvian people Enough of repression!** 

 The rebellion of the Peruvian people follow in the streets and the 
 Repression with more than 63 killed, thousands of prisoners and injuries. 

 From the PCR and its JCR and all the mass movements of which we participate 
 We promote a great mass campaign in solidarity with the 
 Peruvian people, repudiating the fierce repression. 

 The coup d'etat overthrew President Pedro Castillo and imposed the 
 Dina Boluarte de facto presidency. The Congress, controlled by the right 
 Fascist, rejected the possibility of a new election this year. 

 All imperialisms recognized the coup government. They dispute associated 
 to different sectors of the Peruvian ruling classes, but they converge to the 
 time to suppress popular mobilization and quell the rebellion. 

 In Peru the imperialist dispute stains the situation of the country. The traditional 
 Right Proyanqui has given ground to the advance of imperialism 
 Chino, who has become the main commercial partner of Peru and controls 
 Copper(Perú es el segundo productor mundial)And it has important 
 strategic investments, including the construction of the port of Chancay 
 About the Pacific, key to the advance of Chinese penetration on America 
 from the south and for its imperialist dispute over the Pacific. 

 Also Japanese imperialism has important investments that advanced 
 mainly during the presidency of Fujimori. 

 The rebellion of the labor movement and the originals and peasants of the 
 interior of the country, it has been mobilizing large caravans from the provinces 
 Andean and the popular neighborhoods of Lima. 

 To that popular mobilization was added a caravan of reservists and graduates 
 of the armed forces, of more than 10,000 members and say that they would reach 
 Lima 30,000. A fact of enormous importance, that fractures the structure 
 military and adds to the popular claim to sweep the government and congress 
 coup plotters 

 The president of Mexico, López Obrador, requested the release of the president 
 Overthrown, Pedro Castillo. Democratic claim that could not be approved in the 
 Recent CELAC meeting. 

 The depth of the rebellion of the peasant masses, originally, workers, 
 Student and popular Peru claims deep changes. Until where 
 This fight will arrive will depend on a avant -garde capable of opening a 
 Revolutionary path. But surely nothing will be the same in this 
 Brother country. 

 Our duty as revolutionary communists is to raise this situation between 
 The masses in each workplace, study and militancy, so that there are 
 hundreds of pronouncements in solidarity with the heroic struggle of the people 
 Peruvian and ** to demand the Argentine government to claim Pedro's freedom 
 Castle and repudiate the coup d'etat. The Peruvian people are the sole owner of 
 your destiny.** 

 **** 

 ** 2. ** ** The Russian invasion to Ukraine and World War ** 

 “War is a failure of politics, a failure of humanity, a 
 shameful claudication, a defeat against the forces of evil. If we think 
 that in this last century there were three world wars, 1914 to 1918, 1939 to 
 1945 and ** This current one that is a World War. ”** The statement belongs to the Pope 
 Francisco for Russian invasion to Ukraine. 

 ** Putin underestimated the Ukrainian people that ** endorsed that patriotic war. 
 Russian imperialism has used much of its missile reserves to 
 destroy buildings and kill the civilian population, looking for a genocide that 
 Sow fear and get a quick triumph. And it was quite the opposite. 

 ** Russian invasion to Ukraine places the world on the edge of a new war 
 world.** 

 The United States will now send 31 Abrams tanks. The Biden government 
 He decided after Germany agreed to send 14 leopard tanks of his own 
 arsenal. The German government had said that the Leopard was not going to send to 
 less than the United States made the Abrams available. 

 In total, France, England, the United States, Poland, Germany, Holland and 
 Sweden will send around 160 tanks and armored vehicles. 

 Russian imperialism responded to these ads with a new wave of 
 Missile and bombing attacks on kyiv and other cities, and prepares a 
 Great offensive that moves forward to the arrival and commissioning of the tanks. 

 ** Out of Ukraine Russian genocidal imperialism!Out of imperialism 
 Yankee and NATO!Long live the heroic patriotic struggle of the Ukrainian people!** 



 ** 3. ** ** The CELAC and the new scenario of Latin America ** 

 Last week, the meeting of the CABA was held at the Hotel Sheraton de la Caba 
 Community of Latin American and Caribbean States(CELAC). 

 Alberto Fernández presided over CELAC for a year. Was designated as successor 
 Ralph Gonsalves, imposed by Mexico. It is the Prime Minister of San Vicente and 
 the Granada, a small island of the Caribbean, of English speaking, that still
Gonsalves maintains good relations with Cuba and Venezuela, and reiterated support 
 from his country to the Argentine demand for the resumption of negotiations with the 
 United Kingdom regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. 

 The presence of Lula, the new president of Brazil, opened changes in the 
 Region: proposed to resume and strengthen Mercosur, negotiate first with 
 the European Union and then with China. Mercosur integrates it: Argentina, 
 Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela(suspendida desde el 2017). And how 
 Associated states: Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Surinam. 

 With Lula, negotiations for commercial exchange and the 
 possibility of financial aid to Argentina. It was important 
 Presence of Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia. 

 Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a video to CELAC in which he said 
 "The world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformations" and 
 He called to "boost South-South cooperation." 

 Social and union organizations discussed and presented a document with 
 his claims and his anti -imperialist positions, as the partner said 
 Ramiro Berdesegar, leader of the CCC and the PCR. And on 24/1 they mobilized 
 massively to the Sheo, the CCC, the Evita Movement, the CTA and other forces 
 popular 



 ** 4. ** ** Disputes in together for change ** 

 The pro and together for change are a "cat bag" and live a fierce 
 Dispute for charges for this year's elections. 

 After the triumphalist climate for victory in 19 provinces in the elections 
 Of 2021, the internal dispute with the rebellion of provincial leaders grew: 
 Tucumán, Chubut, Salta, Córdoba, Río Negro and others. 

 Patricia Bullrich(PRO), Gerardo Morales(UCR), Maximiliano Ferraro(Coalición
Cívica)and Miguel Ángel Pichetto(Encuentro Republicano Federal)They met 
 This Wednesday, as presidents of the forces that make up together for the 
 Change. They agreed to "sanction" those who do not comply with the internal rules of 
 The alliance for early elections. They try to put a limit to 
 disputes over the lists of the provinces. 

 Macri was planted: "I'm in the ring and I'm going to fight." Elisa Carrió, marked the 
 court to together for change: she wants to be a candidate for president to search 
 unit". 

 Manes asked to expand JXC, and asked Schiaretti to not move on the 
 Elections in Córdoba. 

 The former Buenos Aires Governor María Eugenia Vidal, who is also noted in the 
 Presidential career, speaks of a pension reform "because the system is 
 broken ”, and wants to“ discuss ”the compensation system. 

 This 12/2 are made internal in La Pampa, in which together for change it goes 
 to decide its candidates between radicalism and the Pro. The Front 
 Pampas justicialist unified his lists with little democratic discussion and not 
 It goes to internal. 

 Beyond its internal disputes, macrismo and the sectors that support it 
 They want to return to the government to deepen adjustment, hunger and delivery. 
 ** It is those who direct the main blow of the popular struggle. ** 



 ** 5. ** ** The trial of the Supreme Court ** 

 Congress began to deal with the possibility of a political trial to the Court 
 Supreme Justice. On February 2, the complainants will present and on 9 
 will vote. 

 The government needs two thirds of the Senate and deputies to approve the 
 political judgment, but it does not have or follow half of each of those 
 Chambers with what the political trial is hard to prosper. 

 Beyond this, this discussion puts on the table the corrupt actions of the 
 Argentine Justice and its Supreme Court, which show the 
 rot of the institutions of this state of the ruling classes, which 
 It is used by the different sectors in your dispute, and also to repress and 
 discipline social and political organizations such as CCC and PCR to 
 through judicial causes tailored to its adjustment policy. 



 ** 6. ** ** Unit in the streets against adjustment, for bread, work and sovereignty ** 

 Quilmes neighbors looted trucks with cattle and the meat is distributed in the 
 Street: They don't have to eat. 

 They continue to increase food, rentals, fuels, 
 rates, prepaid and telephony. The price of the cow increased 17%, which 
 The meat would rise to 40%. 

 In the agrarian areas the drought left the worker without work and the chacarero 
 indebted. They lost the initial crops and now they are losing the 
 late Many poor peasants and small producers leave their fields and 
 The concentration of the Earth grows in the hands of the pulses and large 
 landowners. 

 It is urgent financing, subsidies and soft credits, hitting the sector of the 
 Earth owners, which are carried out as income 7 billion 
 dollars, with a special tax. Also a rural lease law that 
 allow the producer to rediscuse the rent in emergency cases such as the 
 Current drought. 

 The ** social emergency ** is not the center of government policy. The
and other outsureres from outside and inside, cutting social plans, 
 salaries and retirement. ** 

 With that great lie that the exit to this situation comes from the 
 Diversification of the agency, the agreements that take over 
 our natural wealth and our sovereignty. 

 A court approved the exploitation of oil in Mar del Plata: to the Shell!
 The company of those who colonize our Malvinas and our sovereignty in the 
 South Atlantic and in the Antarctica sector. They celebrate the delivery of lithium in 
 Gross, when Bolivia exploits him with a national company. 

 Imperialist oil companies impose fuel prices with Super 
 Profits. Vaca Muerta and Cerro Dragon continues to dismembered at the hands of the 
 Imperialist companies. 

 The dispute for our resources grows. The government gives in to the 
 export monopolies and about the control of the so -called hydrovy. He 
 Government of Tierra del Fuego negotiates with China the construction of a port 
 strategic. And Lewis continues to take over Patagonia, giving it to the 
 English imperialism. 

 With this policy the government has lost popular support, because it does not touch the 
 interests of the powerful and hunger, poverty and delivery of 
 Our national sovereignty. This emboldenea to the reactionary right in their 
 plans to deepen the adjustment, as Milei did announcing his "plan 
 chainsaw ”to reduce the State and eliminate health ministries, 
 Education, work and women and diversities. 

 The workers, peasant, native, young people, of the young people, of the 
 women, the struggles in defense of our sovereignty. There are thousands in Argentina 
 Those who come starring their claims and join in the streets 

 ** We continue in the fight to advance these struggles and join with all the 
 popular and national sectors so that these converge and impose from the 
 streets that the crisis is paid by those who are taking it in shovel and breaks 
 The infamous agreement with the IMF and all anti -informed agreements with different 
 Imperialism. Only in this way can we advance in solving emergencies and in the 
 Defense of our national sovereignty. ** 

 **** 

 ** 7. ** ** Follow the head of the struggles and not underestimate the enemy ** 

 Companion Sebastián Saldaña, coordinator of the CCC of the city of Santa 
 Faith, he received at home a threat of death to him, his son, his baby and all his 
 around. The note carried a bullet stuck with tape. Dozens of organizations 
 Santa Fe union and policies, the national table of the CCC and the PCR 
 They repudiated this fact, demanding from the different levels of the State the prompt 
 research and protection of the partner and his family, the clarification 
 of the fact and the punishment of those responsible. 

 This happens a few days after the murder attempt by fellow Lautaro Nahuel 
 Ardura, in La Pampa. They are facts that show that there is a fascist right that 
 Try to hit us, and an enemy state of popular forces. 

 They also advance in different parts of the country judicial causes against 
 Companions and companions of the CCC and the PCR driven by macrista and 
 others of justice. 

 The ruling classes use the entire state apparatus -the "legal" and the 
 MAFIOUS- To isolate and attack those who lead the popular struggle. This demands 
 that we continue in the fight fighting the widest unit as expressed with the 
 great solidarity received from these attacks, and lift the guard to 
 guarantee the continuity of popular struggles for bread, land, work and 
 sovereignty. 



 ** 8. ** ** Our goal is the National and Social Liberation Revolution ** 

 At the close of this edition, hundreds of companions of Río Negro and 
 of different parts of the country made the seventh multisectoral march to 
 Hidden lake, repudiating the presence of the English magnate Lewis and reiterating 
 The sovereign claim in that area of our homeland. 

 On February 1, dozens of organizations, including the CCC and 
 The PTP-PCR, march to the Supreme Court in CABA and the Federal Courts of 
 The whole country demanding the cessation of persecution to social organizations 
 and union, and its leaders. 

 With the resolutions of the 13 PCR Congress we go to meet the great 
 political debate in the masses around what is the exit in favor 
 from town. 

 Putting the center to lead the struggles and accumulate revolutionary forces, 
 We propose affiliation to our party and its youth to all the colleagues and 
 Companions with whom we share the daily struggle. 

 We address that mass discussion with a proposal expressed in our 
 DIEZ PROGRAM MEASURES_. This debate includes the electoral proposals of 
 each district, which are carried out in many provinces, and the national election. 
 But that goes further, because what is at stake is to advance in the unit to 
 the struggle of the popular sectors, on the path of a revolution that
State, in the hands of the working class and the people.

## LLL 2023: "Long live the International Communist League!"

![](Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_header.png)This year again the LLL demonstration took place in Berlin in January. While
this annual event is primarily a showdown of the various forces of the
revolutionist movement in the FRG, this year the Maoists had a different
message: the International Communist League - ICL was founded!A manifold
international contingent proclaimed this historic message at the
demonstration, fulfilling the demand that had been made in the previous years
at the same demonstration - also in the struggle: For the new organization of
the international proletariat!

![LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund
1](Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_1.png)This message was not only powerfully spread, but also joyfully accepted by
many masses. Several times masses asked for the flags of the ICL, which were
carried on the demonstration in four languages - Spanish, English, Turkish and
German. Some even wanted to buy them on the spot. An excerpt of the ICL's
Political Declaration and Principles was distributed as a leaflet, and
Partizan comrades handed out printed brochures with the Declaration in English
and Turkish. Thus, the radiance that the LLL demonstration has in the FRG and
parts of Western Europe was used to celebrate and spread this success of the
Maoists.

![LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund
2](Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_2.png)The participants of the contingent look now full of joy and proletarian
optimism into the future to develop under new, better conditions the work for
the goal of the communists - the communism - and the unification of the
International Communist Movement to push further.
