<p><strong>Marco Valbuena | Chief Information Officer | Communist Party Of ThePhilippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 5, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The recent visit of US Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin served to reinforce themaster-puppet relationship between the US government and the subservientMarcos regime. In exchange for new military hardware contracts and otherpromises, Marcos and his officials gave Austin assurances to allow the US toestablish more military bases and facilities inside AFP military camps andallow “joint maritime patrols” with the US military in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>In doing so, Marcos is more and more allowing the Philippines to be used bythe US as a launching pad for its provocations against China. He ispractically allowing the imperialist US to drag the Philippines into a waragainst its own interest.</p>
<p>By allowing the US to use the country as a base of its operations, Marcos isvirtually turning the Philippines into a target of China’s weapons, whetherfor aggression or counter-aggression.</p>
<p>Austin makes false assurances that the military bases and facilities beingestablished by the US inside the military camps of the AFP are “notpermanent.” The US and its puppets have been using the term “rotationalpresence” to circumvent the prohibition of the 1987 constitution againstforeign military bases.</p>
<p>However, the fact cannot be denied that US military forces have maintainedpermanent presence in the country for more than twenty years now, stationingtroops from Luzon to Mindanao. The US has kept weapons and military equipmentin various military bases. Naval warships of the US have regularly docked inPhilippine ports and other parts of the country’s waters, anytime they wish,with or without permission of the Philippine government.</p>
<p>Austin’s visit to South Korea and the Philippines forms part of the USgovernment’s continuing strategy of preparing the war theater against China.The US geopolitical strategy is to encircle China from all sides and provokeit by undermining the One China policy, inciting subversion in Taiwan, makingnaval passes through the Taiwan strait and patrols in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The Filipino people, together with peoples of Asia and the world, mustcontinue to demand a stop to imperialist war mongering and an end to warpreparations especially by the US. They must demand the dismantling of all USmilitary bases and call for the removal of US and other foreign militarytroops in the country, as well as the dismantling of Chinese militaryfacilities within its maritime territory.</p>
