<p><strong>Marco Valbuena | Chief Information Officer | Communist Party Of ThePhilippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 4, 2023</strong></p>
<p>As expected, the Marcos government declared its refusal to cooperate with theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in its plan to commence pretrialinvestigation into the charges of crimes against humanity against RodrigoDuterte over his sham “war on drugs” during his time in Malacañang.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions are Duterte’s veritable defense lawyers. They are usingthe people’s money and the entire Philippine government to stop any and alleffort to make Duterte account for the killing of more than 30,000 peopleduring the violent spree of police and vigilante operations which he orderedand incited.</p>
<p>Marcos falsely declares “confidence in the fully functional domestic judicialsystem” which clearly has failed to address the aspirations for justice of thetens of thousands of families clearly who fell victim to Duterte’s carnage.</p>
<p>In Duterte’s defense, the Marcos government hypocritically invokes sovereigntyto stop the ICC from performing its sworn duty as an international body thatclosely works with the United Nations and other widely recognized multilateralagencies.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions have the least credibility to talk of defendingsovereignty in the face of its continuing failure to assert the country’smaritime rights in the West Philippine Sea as recognized by the 2016 decisionof the International Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p>What defending sovereignty is Marcos talking about when he has not lifted afinger to end the Mutual Defense Treaty and unequal military treaties with theUnited States, and in fact, has acceded to the US plan to construct moremilitary bases and facilities in AFP camps under the Enhanced DefenseCooperation Agreement (EDCA).</p>
<p>The Filipino people must oppose the Marcos government’s refusal to cooperatewith the ICC, and push the demand for exposing the entire truth about thebogus “war on drugs,” and for Duterte to be punished for all his crimes.</p>
