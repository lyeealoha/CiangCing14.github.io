They are usingthe people’s money and the entire Philippine government to stop any and alleffort to make Duterte account for the killing of more than 30,000 peopleduring the violent spree of police and vigilante operations which he orderedand incited.\n\nMarcos falsely declares “confidence in the fully functional domestic judicialsystem” which clearly has failed to address the aspirations for justice of thetens of thousands of families clearly who fell victim to Duterte’s carnage.\n\nIn Duterte’s defense, the Marcos government hypocritically invokes sovereigntyto stop the ICC from performing its sworn duty as an international body thatclosely works with the United Nations and other widely recognized multilateralagencies.\n\nMarcos and his minions have the least credibility to talk of defendingsovereignty in the face of its continuing failure to assert the country’smaritime rights in the West Philippine Sea as recognized by the 2016 decisionof the International Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nWhat defending sovereignty is Marcos talking about when he has not lifted afinger to end the Mutual Defense Treaty and unequal military treaties with theUnited States, and in fact, has acceded to the US plan to construct moremilitary bases and facilities in AFP camps under the Enhanced DefenseCooperation Agreement (EDCA).\n\nThe Filipino people must oppose the Marcos government’s refusal to cooperatewith the ICC, and push the demand for exposing the entire truth about thebogus “war on drugs,” and for Duterte to be punished for all his crimes.\n\n> Source : https://philippinerevolution.nu/statements/on-marcos-refusal-to-> cooperate-with-icc/', 'tags': ['AFP', 'communist party of the philippines', 'CPP', 'CPP-NPA-NDF', 'CPP-NPA-NDFP', 'Duterte', 'EDCA', 'Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement', 'Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr', 'Ferdinand Marcos Jr.', 'ICC', 'International Arbitral Tribunal', 'International Criminal Court', 'Marco L.
