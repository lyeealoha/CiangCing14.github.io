<p>Much noise was made when Luiz Inácio fired, on the 21st, some 80 militarypersonnel serving at the Planalto and the then Army Commander, Júlio César deArruda, replacing him with Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva. Some, dizzy with theblind belief in the "stability" of bourgeois democracy and the country'srotten institutions, and that Yankee imperialism "will not permit a coup,"went so far as to proclaim that the effective "Lula government" was beinginaugurated, without the tutelage of the Armed Forces. Luiz Inácio proclaimedthat he distrusted the Armed Forces, that he wanted a Cabinet of InstitutionalSecurity (GSI) without military staff, and played games for the audience thathe would not accept military assistants (and soon after, would have them), ina staging that he would not submit to "military power," to try to restrict thegenerals' room for maneuver through isolation in public opinion.</p>
<p>On the 31st, "surprising" a total of zero politically aware people, LuizInácio nominated 122 military personnel to the GSI. The maths is clear:instead of restricting the presence of the militaries and, therefore, theirinfluence in the government, the president of the republic increased it!Meanwhile, the press reports that the PT president gave the army permission toprevent the Military Police of the Federal District from acting, on the nightof January 8, against the encampment, at the Army Headquarters. The episode,which involved manoeuvres with tanks by the armed force to dissuade theMilitary Police, was approved by Luiz Inácio, in the face of pressure from thegenerals. As is well known, this manoeuvre was carried out so that active andreserve officers and their families could leave the camp and not be arrested.</p>
<p>Now, what does this reveal? That the performance of a strengthened LuizInácio, who makes it happen with the military, lasted less than a soap bubble,since the alleged strength attributed to the government is a chimera, anillusion. The opportunists and liberals do not see that the defence of thiscorrupt and permissive bourgeois democracy with all kinds of violence againstthe people does not move them, on the contrary, it provokes in them repulsionand, above all, distrust and anger. They pretend not to know, but they knowvery well that in politics the effective force are the masses, and not thenotes from entities and offices, innocuous when they have no material support.But they want to believe this and try to fool the masses into believing thisfantasy too.</p>
<p>To the extent that the government tries to restrict the coup movement withcabinet agreements and grandiloquent declarations about "democracy" - this,unknown by the great masses in their daily lives - it only makes itself inept,while the real force is increasingly with the generals (today, the troops and,now, they are playing to win over the masses, mainly the small and middlebourgeoisie and counting on the Bolsonarist evangelicals among the poor). Thegovernment is leaning towards capitulation; after all, how could it beotherwise, if since the 2018 elections they have been silent about themilitary's constant coup pronouncements? Not a single criticism, onlyappeasement! After all, what can the government of the reactionary coalition,in which the big bourgeois and landowners, servants of imperialism, exercisepower? If it had a modicum of decency it would have immediately called on themasses to take to the streets in defence of threatened democratic freedoms!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indigenous people are being killed, as in the horrific and criminalcase against the Yanomami, and peasants are systematically slaughtered intheir just struggle for land. On the morning of 28 January, police from BOPE,the Rondônia Military Police, shot peasants who were climbing into a boat tocross a river; the soldiers arrested two young people, dragged them to adeserted place, tortured them, even cutting out the tongue of one of them, andthen executed them in cold blood. The press monopolies, the illustriouspoliticians and institutions of justice, heroes of the defence of thisdemocracy, are completely silent. This has nothing to do with your democracy,does it?</p>
<p>It must also be said that the change of generals in command of the Army, madeby Luiz Inácio, does not change absolutely nothing of the nature of the force,and even does not alter its coup pretensions, which are unanimous among thehigh officerate, whose only important divergence is when, in which moment andsituation the military coup d'état will culminate. Just see that the nowlauded "legalist commander", Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, was the same oneconsidered to be the protagonist in the writing of Villas-Bôas' intimidatingtweet, against Luiz Inácio's HC, in 2018 - a tweet that, confessedly, waswritten by the ACFA to intervene in national political life. This is the"legalistic general", the supreme guarantee of democracy in Brazil for thepress monopoly and opportunism. How poorly they are covered!</p>
<p>The ACFA is calculating and reformulating its plans for military interventionevery day, looking for the right time to intervene, encouraging smalldestabilizations using the "green chickens" as a cannon fodder, and soonsigning new agreements with the government in which it is strengthened in therole of the mediative power [ <em>Poder Moderador</em> ] ; meanwhile, it is trying togain support from its Northern master and backing from public opinion to tryto crush the people's uprising the instant it raises its righteous anger.</p>
<p>To stop the coup in motion, it is impossible to count on the opportunistaristocracy, intoxicated by decades of conviviality in palaces of the oldstate and expectations of reigning for many more. The least that can be doneis to support the masses, mobilising them for their minimum rights, trampledon on a daily basis, through strikes, land seizures, occupation ofuniversities and schools, in a torrent of protests and revolutionarystruggles; without a drop of illusion with the democracy of the rich.</p>
