<p>Britain is currently paralyzed by hundreds of thousands of workers' strikes with the public sector. At the same time, protests are taking place over the whole country against the government. </p>
<p>More than 23,000 schools in the country will close when more than 100,000 teachers go on strike in England and Wales. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-04T04-00-00-00-00/london-uk-16th-jan-2023-protesters-with-placards-protesters-and-speakers-gather-opposite-downing-street-for-the-protect-the-right-to-strike-emergency-demo-including-members-of-the-rmt-t-1.jpeg" />Teachers' strikes hit broadly because another purpose, in addition to civil education for the bourgeoisie, is that schools act as day care institutions Breeding from proletarian families. Without a place to send children to the work hours, people must seek alternatives to get their children cared for. It is reported that some family members will take time off, which is also evidenced by other areas of production in the country. </p>
<p>At the same time as the teachers' strike, university lecturers, drivers, bus drivers and security guards work on requirements for higher wages, better pension and job security. </p>
<p>In addition, several mass strikes are expected later this month, as tens of thousands of ambulance rescuers across the country go on strike on February 10 as a result of a long -term dispute for higher wages and more staff. </p>
<p>The strikes and protests also take place against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak OgHan's government's new strike breaking law, which should make it possible to fire workers who, under strike, do not perform a 'minimum service', ie. Not least partly works underlining. Rishi OgHan's government tries in vain to follow in the footsteps of Margeret Thatcher's footsteps, as strikers as they themselves admit the problems that the proletariat organization brings them. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-04T04-00-00-00-00/th-4119143806-edited.jpeg" />The British trade unions' national organization TUC points out that the British get the same as the equivalent of 1700 kroner less a month today, even ten years ago. </p>
<p>At the end of last year, more than 100,000 British nurses launched nationwide strikes, divided into 76 public hospitals, Sunhedscenters, which initiated the first national nurse strike the country ever has seen. The demands of the strike are similar to About the requirements of the nurses in Danmarkkbage in 2021, with requirements for, among other things. higher pay. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-04T04-00-00-00-00/th-1179436622-edited.jpeg" />We see how the crisis of imperialism, which is carried by the proletariat, pushes the proletariat into battle and opposition to the attacks of our rights. The proletariat looks through the imperialist bourgeoisis lies and fears as they try to spread about the imperialist war while deeper and attack the proletariat's rights in The name of "Defense Relief-Europe".</p>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> The debate continues in and around the party Red, which has so far held a steady no to Norwegian weapons to the Zelenskiy government. For Norwegian weapons shipments, this is of little significance, for the rest of the Storting supports the government in this matter, but for Red the question is still important. </strong> </p>
<p>Central Board Synne Høyforslett Bjørbakk from the Red Party Party candidate for the county council elections in Nordland and a member of the Government Defense Commission. The newspaper Klassekampen writes that she disagrees with large parts of the party leadership in the view of Norwegian weapons to Ukraine. The controversy issue will be decided at the Red National Meeting held in Stavanger in late April. </p>
<p>The Government has just chosen to send lephard tanks, like several other European countries. Bjørbakk is concerned that the escalation may be scaling down the war and that a dangerous situation will be even more dangerous. She says the tension can increase in the northern areas and that Norway is not served with it. </p>
<p>She says to the Class Fight: "Maybe Ukraine closes. But the war can also end very badly in the sense that the war escalates beyond Ukraine, and core weapons are used. I think the political debate, and at least last week, take too lightly on the seriousness of the situation. I lack a critical officity that questions whether other other action options are to send more weapons. " Bjørbakk is also clear that the war can be blly, regardless of whether Norway sends weapons or not. </p>
<p>Bjørbakk states that Ukraine leads a legitimate defense war and that party supports this, but that the war also has a "geopolitical side". She refers to Russian scientist Cecilie Hellestveit and her analysis of the war as "Enland War on Sea", where Russia sees it as crucial to have control of Haveti north and in the south(Svartehavet)To resist the US and China pressure, and that USA and have their interests. The Red Central Board says the war in Ukraine is special because it has the potential to escalate beyond Ukraine and become a single war war. </p>
<p>Finally, she states that she does not want a new party, and does not agree with Desom says this is necessary if Red says yes to weapons. She and several other hares signaled this attitude, and so it looks like it is unlikely to happen, or that if it happens, it will be a relatively small peel. </p>
<p>In short, the people of the media are: Russian imperialism Har attack Ukraine, the Ukrainian nation leads a legitimate liberation struggle, Somvi supports without reservation. Zelelskiy's regime is the result of the "orange revolution" and Euromaidan, where, among other things, fascist paramilitary and Yankee imperialism was eventually heavily involved. Zelelskiy is a lackeys to mainly the United States, and does not represent the interests of the Ukrainian nation. US-Nato's support for its Lakei is not in the Ukrainian nation interest. The main thing for anti-imperialists in Norway is to combat Russian imperialism's war of attack and support the Ukrainian people, without becoming a sub-US-NATO and Norwegian imperialism's war efforts. </p>

<p>We publish excerpts of an interview with Airaudo Secretary of the CGIL Piedmont </p>
<p><strong> Airaudo: "Now our struggle is also teaming with the top managers" </strong> <strong> The reconfirmed secretary of the CGIL of Piedmont: "The union must be the economic agenda" </strong> </p>
<p>«I have not invited the top managers of Michelin and Lavazza and vice president of the Turin industrialists to our congress because I became becoming. But because I believe that the union cannot limit itself to managing the crises but must become the protagonist of the exocial economic agenda of a territory ". <strong> Giorgio Airaudo today will be reconfirmed secretariative of the CGIL of Piedmont </strong>. </p>
<p><strong> An unusual choice to open a CGIL congress by hosting the topmanager. </strong> "Far from it. First we talked about peace with Luciana Castellina and the delegates of Lavorocon. The top managers were there with us because there are no more luoghidove to be able to establish <strong> a common work agenda ». </strong> </p>
<p><strong> In what sense are the places of debate lack? </strong> "Once there was Fiat who regulated and managed everything. Then certain routes came to the lounges. Today there is nothing more in Piedmont. The problems are we have to find a way to face them and solve them together ». </p>
<p><strong> Companies then focus on flexibility. </strong> "This has been an emergency for many years. In Italy we have 45 methods of entry into the world of work, in Spain they have reduced Adue and in fact create jobs. Among other things, Madrid has just adapted salaries to the cost of living, raising the wages of 8 percent. We do not even do not manage to manage the health crisis ». </p>
<p><strong> Do you need more public investments? </strong> "Certainly. The Piedmontese health is strict. We managed with extreme effort to stabilize a thousand nurses but it is too little especially for a region that aged. " </p>
<p><strong> In fact, today CGIL speaks more about health than Mirafiori. Is it a sign deitempi? </strong> «We also talked about Mirafiori. I asked the Albertocirio governor on the agreement between the Region and Stellantis on the RECYCLING HUB of the Fabbitarinese. It is a reserved agreement that we know nothing about. And among others from which the union was unexpectedly excluded ».</p>

<p><strong>February 4, 2023</strong></p>
<p>As expected, the Marcos government declared its refusal to cooperate with theInternational Criminal Court(ICC)in its plan to commence pretrialinvestigation into the charges of crimes against humanity against RodrigoDuterte over his sham “war on drugs” during his time in Malacañang.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions are Duterte’s veritable defense lawyers. They are usingthe people’s money and the entire Philippine government to stop any and alleffort to make Duterte account for the killing of more than 30,000 peopleduring the violent spree of police and vigilante operations which he orderedand incited.</p>
<p>Marcos falsely declares “confidence in the fully functional domestic judicialsystem” which clearly has failed to address the aspirations for justice of thetens of thousands of families clearly who fell victim to Duterte’s carnage.</p>
<p>In Duterte’s defense, the Marcos government hypocritically invokes sovereigntyto stop the ICC from performing its sworn duty as an international body thatclosely works with the United Nations and other widely recognized multilateralagencies.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions have the least credibility to talk of defendingsovereignty in the face of its continuing failure to assert the country’smaritime rights in the West Philippine Sea as recognized by the 2016 decisionof the International Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p>What defending sovereignty is Marcos talking about when he has not lifted afinger to end the Mutual Defense Treaty and unequal military treaties with theUnited States, and in fact, has acceded to the US plan to construct moremilitary bases and facilities in AFP camps under the Enhanced DefenseCooperation Agreement(EDCA).</p>
<p>The Filipino people must oppose the Marcos government’s refusal to cooperatewith the ICC, and push the demand for exposing the entire truth about thebogus “war on drugs,” and for Duterte to be punished for all his crimes.</p>

<p>On March 8, we want to be an important avant-garde, opposition, strong, visible, visible women against the masters, the reactionary we have, clerical-fascist, with the characters within it declaredlysexists. We have already done this on November 26th, but <strong> March 8 èsciopero!And with the strike, starting from the jobs, we say clearly that it deals with a class struggle, a clash between the barbarism of this social quest and our bi/dream that our whole life must change. </strong> and in this We women, who are doubly exploited, doubly oppressed, when we fight we have an extra gear, because we want not to the miserable and more increasingly impossible improvements but we want the revolution!</p>
<p>Meloni's government raised the black flag of "god, homeland, family" ... and children, because women are "weighed" and can only receive elastic on the basis of the number of children they have and who do for IlCapitale and today For the imperialist war, and prepares to attack the abortion, which always accompanies the double oppression and the Middle Ages for women. Today this black flag is the useful ideology for imposing misery, war, attack on work, with the inevitable increase in deifeminicides. </p>
<p>This is why this March 8, in these women's strike we must say Chiaroper what we fight. We do not want a "radical transformation of the capitalist system", we want its reversal!Not to be able to equity, ecological transition that respects the environment and of the existences, equitable distribution, etc. etc. To those who every day at the maximon conferences, in the Assizes do "bla, blah, blah"(come dice Greta)And then in the facts it takes our lives. </p>
<p>We must bring and fight for a platform that arises from the struggles of the workers, precarious workers, unemployed, women of the squares. This is the platform that we also propose in this assembly( <em>nota</em> )Today the workers say that they no longer do it for the workload, lepening conditions at work and out of work, in homes. And some stannogy 'transforming this cry on a strike, fight. An important example, also for the other workers, are <strong> the workers of the Beretta </strong>, which by organizing them directly a assembly at the end of October, an assembly, managed directly by the workers, launch a message of the diproagonism, unity, does not delegate, towards The other women, workers. </p>
<p><strong> And on February 23 there will be a new assembly, this time electronic, to organize the strike of 8 March on the workplace, to which we call to be there. </strong> </p>
<p>MFPR </p>
<p>_ We get that the Slai Cobas for the class union has already independently the women's strike, open to all workers, of the 8marzo. This notice unions covers all workers, also to other unions or not registered ._ </p>

<p>In writing, comrades emphasize how the International Communist Association(KKL)has taken the chairman Mao's position in relation to the role of Comrade Stalin. He was a great Marxist-Leninist who once systematiconism and played a decisive role in World War II to victory in socialism. In addition, when it comes to comrade Stalin, he does not forget his leadership at the Communist International Settle Congress, which laid the basis for successfully developing a joint front during World War II. Due to the work of that front, after World War II, the proletariat indictaturies won in several European countries, while Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, later, were also in the leadership of the People's President. </p>
<p>The article also states that Chairman Mao is a struggle for the battle of all humanity in the history of all humanity. According to him, this battle should not only be seen between the Soviet Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, as the Soviet Union won a war against Nazi Germany and its allies, under the great leadership of the great leadership of Toveristalin. In total, World War II by paying 25 million Soviet citizens. This great anti -fascist warfare for a very important source of inspiration for justified freedom in the multi -borne countries in the third world. </p>

<p>The comrades borrow in the article on the commandment of the Mover Stalin, published on July 28, "<a href="https://marxismileninismi.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/stalin-ei-askeltakaan-taaksepain-1942/">Not for step -by -step</a>". In order to defend the Soviet People's increasing efforts to defend the Socialist Fatherland. The Soviet Union is not a desert, but people - workers, farmers, intellectuals, fathers and mothers, wives, brothers and children. An area whose enemy has taken over from the Federation of Family and what the enemy wants to hijacks is bread for jams for the army and civilians, iron and fuel industry, factories and equipment that delivers weapons to the army; This also means railways. After lost in Ukraine, the Belarus, the Baltic States, the Donetsk Pool and the other large areas, we have been a lot of people, bread, metals, factories and production facilities. We leave the enemy to strengthen them, weaken us again, our defense and our homeland ... Therefore, a discussion of an endless withdrawal that we have large areas that our country is large and rich, that we have a huge population to distribute. These discussions are harmful times as they weaken us and strengthen the enemy. If you are not retreating, we will be left without bread, fuel, metal, raw materials, factories and railways ... This means it's time to stop. No more step back!This is our slogan on this ethnic. </p>

With the conquest of the city, the fasis seek to build a station, to attack the oil fields of the peripheral casual and to cut the Volga traffic routes. City conquest was also important for fascists because it was made up of a lot of Soviet military equipment and about 70 % of the oil used by the city. The city's dwarf is also illustrated by the fact that the city was named after Comrade Stalin. </p>

To the northwest of the city, the 5th Army Army and the 21st Army of the Romanian fascist team attacked, crushing them perfectly in the evening of the operation. Also the next day(20.11)Red Army Roller Show in the south side of the Romanian Stalingrad front.

In addition, the tactics of the country burned in the Soviet people during the use of the use of the Soviet people and the organizational partisan troops for organizational fascists. As he retreated, the Red Army burned all the fields and blasted the factories and buildings, so that there was nothing more than the ruins and empty fields of the buildings. It was a surprise to the fascists that the spirit of socialism was such as such efforts. The comrades also noted in their writing website that Stalingrad's Battle as a proof of evidence that people in war do not decide on weapons. </p>

<p>Comrades wrote that the Soviet people were aware of the proletariat at the horizontal of dictatorship, the revolution was at stake. This collective awareness guaranteed that the fascists' backs received large partisan troops with rifles, hand grenades and explosives to destroy the enemy and to disturb it, for example, by destruction of the railways. This was not a simple choice, as partisans always waited for death if they were left in the fascist's nails. </p>

The comrades of the writing decide to these words: "With the glorious red army's rifles, Nazi Germany was crushed, the dictatorship of the socialist proletariat was erected in East Germany. The fact that the Communist Party and SNTL's red flag fluttered by the German dark jaraun(Reichstag)On the roof, there is undoubtedly a great time for a moment -intermediate proletariat.

<p>On the other hand, the Walter Wayar slapping referred to the electoral issue, he established the unit. _ “The popular field has to unite behind a political project and not running as an unfortunate one where we can get two or two less, because that perhaps solves an economic problem to a family, but not the problems of the province” _ ... </p>
<p>The president of Kolina, Diego Arroyo, warned that many "underestimate" this political designer; “_Subestimate that we have the ability to manage, to think about people, that we cannot handle a ministry, but today they are all the silver of the national government, 80% of a budget are lined to the province, and where are the works? ”, _ Claimed. He celebrated that Hoyel the Front of all has national and provincial legislators and pointed out that _ "that scares him."
Then Senator Sergio Leavy **** revalidated the contribution of social organizations and took advantage of the time to refer to the electoral fronts that are consolidated, as we advance, together for the change and the legal officialism, and of the three it distanced itself. _ "The only way to get ahead Escon struggles and fight", said the president of the PV. He stressed that they already work in a government plan and was critical of provincial management.

We have to make the impossible possible ”<em>, the leader sentenced .</em>“ We dreamed largely and in a jump managed by the retrograde oligarchy, misogyny and macho, we aspire to have aarer and feminist governor.

<p><strong>February 5, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The recent visit of US Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin served to reinforce themaster-puppet relationship between the US government and the subservientMarcos regime. In exchange for new military hardware contracts and otherpromises, Marcos and his officials gave Austin assurances to allow the US toestablish more military bases and facilities inside AFP military camps andallow “joint maritime patrols” with the US military in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>In doing so, Marcos is more and more allowing the Philippines to be used bythe US as a launching pad for its provocations against China. He ispractically allowing the imperialist US to drag the Philippines into a waragainst its own interest.</p>
<p>By allowing the US to use the country as a base of its operations, Marcos isvirtually turning the Philippines into a target of China’s weapons, whetherfor aggression or counter-aggression.</p>
<p>Austin makes false assurances that the military bases and facilities beingestablished by the US inside the military camps of the AFP are “notpermanent.” The US and its puppets have been using the term “rotationalpresence” to circumvent the prohibition of the 1987 constitution againstforeign military bases.</p>
<p>However, the fact cannot be denied that US military forces have maintainedpermanent presence in the country for more than twenty years now, stationingtroops from Luzon to Mindanao. The US has kept weapons and military equipmentin various military bases. Naval warships of the US have regularly docked inPhilippine ports and other parts of the country’s waters, anytime they wish,with or without permission of the Philippine government.</p>
<p>Austin’s visit to South Korea and the Philippines forms part of the USgovernment’s continuing strategy of preparing the war theater against China.The US geopolitical strategy is to encircle China from all sides and provokeit by undermining the One China policy, inciting subversion in Taiwan, makingnaval passes through the Taiwan strait and patrols in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The Filipino people, together with peoples of Asia and the world, mustcontinue to demand a stop to imperialist war mongering and an end to warpreparations especially by the US. They must demand the dismantling of all USmilitary bases and call for the removal of US and other foreign militarytroops in the country, as well as the dismantling of Chinese militaryfacilities within its maritime territory.</p>

<p>After the Interior Minister Baden Wurttemberg, Thomas Strobl(CDU)The last turn of the year as a "normal New Year's Eve", he has completely changed his position and calls for strongererepression and surveillance against the people. </p>
<p>The grouping for this advance and attack on our rights is very flimsy. As an official justification, they take New Year's Eve, both not a lot has happened, which Strobl said himself. Saschabinder of the SPD accused Strobl: "Not a single case can be normal for us." The FDP MP Julia Goll spoke of 19 injuries. </p>
<p>The fact that someone drunk in Heidelberg with rockets on minor -year -old shot and rapid procedure was sentenced to 9 months in prison without preservation serves Jetztal's prime example of how to deal with people in the future and naturally pay all the rebellious masses and revolutionaries that come into conflicts with denBulls. There should be an official interest and maintain the state's monopoly of violence. This is the real reason: the fear of loss of control, eating the funds in order to efficiently repression on unspeakable. </p>
<p>The grows reject the body cams first because it was filmed in innote situations and private rooms. The FDP and SPD think that rescue powers do not want cameras. Justifiably!Because mandiese creap with cameras that can be used for law enforcement and thus penetrate the private living space, they are made beneficiaries. Nothing has been voted yet, but with this dramatization the discussion is continued towards more repression and the soil for another attack on our rights is prepared.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong> Outside Alfredo so as 41 bis, no to the obstacle life imprisonment </strong> <strong> Save the life of Alfredo and his political identity </strong> </p>
<p>The anarchist prisoner Alfredo Cossitato is today on the 108th day of hunger strike against the 41 bis regime and against the life sentence. </p>
<p>For revolutionary political prisoners, the 41bis has a dual function, that of revenge towards those who do not regret and claim revolutionary propriating, and the cleansing of the struggles towards the outside. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Meloni admitted it candidly: "so it ends up at 41 by the detention during detention, he sent messages to the anarchists who were misleading" continue the fight, organize yourself ". </p>
<p>In the L'Aquila prison, where there is the highest number of prisoners in 41 bis and is the only one in Italy to also have a female section, the revolutionary communist prisoner Nadia Lioce is also held in the regimeni hard prison. Law in the measures that every 2 years are issued to perrtically firm them the 41 bis: "The temporary temporaneeeclissi of the brigatist phenomenon must be evaluated with the utmost prudence that suggest not to exclude lapped of a recovery of the armed struggle in the medium/long term, also in consideration of an overall panorama of social clashes, of an evercreasing gap of living conditions and little job opportunities ". </p>
<p>The bourgeois state, the governments, want to impose their "prayer" inside and outside. And this today is even more evident in the crisis phase and departure to the inter-imperialist war, with a modern Meloni government that aims to change also the constitutional rights, which makes Stanel properly fascist characters, in open contrast to his own laws and that now, with the next rules of the min. Of justice(inserite nel decreto anti rave)He wants to continue to cover politicorrotti, fascists, "legal" criminality. </p>
<p>The same capture of Messina Denaro is used to strengthen and give again to the regime of 41bis and the obstacle life imprisonment, always putting the same mafia and terrorism plan, clearly meaning by "terrorism" the organizations, the struggles of the revolutionaries, to overturn with all Learmi This capitalist system, its state, to its governments necessary. </p>
<p>The repression that this state is carrying out and advances more and more to hit the social and political struggles, finds its tip of icebergs towards political prisoners; towards those who, in various ways, actually places the truth, the need for the revolutionary struggle against a state that attacks the proletarian straight, of the masses. From the most elementary and daily ones, the law, work, to salary, to health, to school, to the more general ones. Aostatato who today drags us into the war. </p>
<p>But on the one hand this state with repression is strong, on the other, precisely for this reason, it shows that it is afraid of the mere fact that a radical change of this society is alluded. </p>
<p>In this context, the provision of the state against Alfredo Cosenza must be seen, who has already served the sentence for having injured Genoa the manager of the nuclear venture and is now accused, without evidence, of an attack on the age of the students of the Carabinieri of Fossano who Non hacausato neither deaths nor injuries. But this is considered political massacre the state and for this reason you want to segregate it for life. His guilt has been from the fact that he continues to fight with the hunger strike and in this sense is a living indication not to bend.
This is to kill a person. And rightly so, in his statement of hunger strike he said: "Life does not make sense in this pervive tomb". </p>
<p>But the ferocity of this bourgeois state goes hand in hand with its stupidity: putting silent an anarchist has raised a stone that is falling back to him. The affair of Alfredo, with his indomitable hunger strike, was in the public domain and has aroused vast solidarity, reopening a broad debate on the torture/murderer prison, on a bourgeois state that has fulfilled for its massacres(da quelle nelle piazze a quelle sullavoro/alternanza scuola-lavoro, da quelle in mare degli immigrati, a quellenelle carceri dei detenuti)And accuses an anarchist of massacre that he has not killed. </p>
<p>Today this mobilization must be continued, developed even more and extended, using various means and shapes, investing every reality, from those already in sincere democratic fighting, and bringing it more and more among the popular masses, Ilavoratori. Because this repression concerns all those who rebel, who fight against the existing state. Because the repression of the state state on revolutionaries is the central part of the travel of class war, popular masses and masters, state, governments at the service of this exploitation, lack of work, war, misery, diatribe to civil rights and democracy itself </p>
<p>All solidarity are important, but we in this battle wants the solidarity that respects what the same as the so -called: "Until the end against 41bis and the life imprisonment": "Miopterrrre will with all forces to forced nutrition . They will be forced to hover in bed ... to their ruthlessness and fury opposed my myphrum, tenacity and the will of a conscious anarchist and revolutionary ... ". </p>
<p>Our password is, therefore, "outside Alfredo so far from 41 bis, noall'orgastolo obstacle; save life and his political identity". </p>
<p>This is today what must be achieved in all possible ways. If we win we will have taken a step forward for the fight against this murderer StateBorghese. </p>

<p>Intervention at the Factory for the preparation of the proletariaticapitalist assembly of Rome of 18 February and of the mobilization of the integralist on the days of 23-24-25 February from the blog: <a href="http://cobasperilsindatodiclasse.blogspot.com/2023/02/3- February-stanaris -Dalmine-Guerra-e.html">http://cobasperilsindatodiclasse.blogspot.com/2023/02/3- February-stanaris -Dalmine-Guerra-e.html</a> </p>
<p>Tenaris closed the third quarter with net profit of 608 million dollar revenues that have risen by 6% to almost 3 billion dollars(2,97 miliardi didollari)</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter, the group provides for further growth in sales, favored by the increase in deliveries for projects already in progress and by new price increases in prices, with a further recovery of the Free Cash Flow. </p>
<p><strong> "The conditions in the energy sector indicate that it can be confirmed by the level of investment, with low levels of skills and stocks, uncertainty about the impact of further penalties on Russian exports and a renewed attention to energy safety in the world" - explains Tenaris - According to which "the global supplies is limited and all the diapers and signing sources will be needed to satisfy the growing question". </strong> <em>fonte the press14-11-2022</em> </p>
<p><strong> From Lenin Socialism and war - </strong> <strong> _ the current war is a warmillist war _ </strong> </p>
<p>_ Capitalism has developed concentration to such an extent, that entire ramidell' industry are in the hands of unions, trusts, of billionaire dicapitalist associations, _ <em> and almost all the</em> </p>
<p><em>globo is divided between these "gentlemen of capital", or in the form of omitted colonies the network of financial exploitation that binds with a thousand foreign ipaese threads. Free trade and competition have been replaced by the tendency to monopoly, from the usurpation of lands to use deicapitical, to export raw materials, etc. As a liberator of the nations as in the fight against feudalism, capitalism, in the phase, has become the greatest oppressor of the nations. From progressive, capitalism has become reactionary; He has developed forces to such an extent, that humanity must or go to socialism or endure for years, and perhaps for decades, the armed struggle among the "great" powers for artificial laconsering of capitalism through colonies, monopolies, hiprivilers and the national oppressions of each species.</em> </p>
<h4>the mobilization of the working class is central to the fight against interimperialist lagura for the profits of the masters.</h4>
<h4>a theme to be deepened in the National ProletariaticApiece National Assembly of February 18 Rome. Against the Government of the Industries of the Leonardo/ Fincantieri etc. and at the service of multinationalides energy.</h4>
<h3></h3>
<h4>follows the <strong> flyer distributed to the workers of the Tenaris Dalmine incratic to the propaganda of Padron Rocca who wants to pass as a normal imperialist lagura of division of the world of which instead the masters of themultinationals are active and decisive part </strong> *<em>.</em> *</h4>
<hr />
<p><strong> Against the master's policy for workers' policy </strong> </p>
<p><strong> National Anti -Anciotteistic proletarian assembly 18 February Rome </strong> </p>
<hr />
<p>The masters need to affirm their conception of the world between Ilavoratori, for this reason Rocca comes to the factory to speak with the perlegitty employees as normal a capitalist system where to close or renovate factories in the world is a necessity to make profits and the war becomes an opportunity /needs to get out of the crisis in which the world systemimperialist is based on large monopolies such as Tenaris. </p>
<p>Padron Rocca wants to celebrate his billionaire records "together", while even those who are lucky enough to have a job are increasingly poor and exploited, with wages cut by the increases and with the collective rights transformed inpounded by the company. </p>
<p>The capitalist knows very well that the workers or rather the sononessari workforce for production(per fare andare le fabbriche), but on the other they are a cost and therefore for the masters it is inevitable to continue harshly to stay on the market, it is inevitable that there are the dead on the air and injuries caused by the work rhythms. </p>
<p>This is the ideology that guides the actions of the masters, not so much because they are sonocactive, but because it is the only way to continue existing as a classparassite class that lives on the waged work of the workers. To maintain this political on the life of the workers, they need a state, greased, of laws that defend their class interests, making that we are all on the same boat. </p>
<p>So in the pandemic crisis and now in the war the masters are increasingly rich, the increasingly poorer workers, this is the law of the capital system, the increase in profits corresponds to the decrease in wages, because capitalist ilsistema is based on the opposing interests between masters Eraopei, between capital and work, exploiters and exploited. </p>
<p>The masters needed war to get out of the crisis in which the world imperialist Ilsistema pours, the workers instead need to organize their class war to end with this system, they must put their policy field which today is a struggle for work, the salary, idiots, for another worker government. </p>
<p>The conscious workers are not soldiers in the hands of the masters, but a classy -class that has nothing to lose except the chains of the work and the historical task of building a new power in the hands of the Operai. For this perspective we must return to fight against Governoguerra and Carovita, against the worsening of the Degabbrica working conditions(salario, sicurezza, precarietà), building the workers' organization, the class union to resist and the partocomunista of the revolution to go to the attack. </p>
<p>The second anti -capitalist national proletarian assembly to be held on 18 February in Rome is the concrete tool to connect and raise the struggle, from the general to the general, to center the defense of the interests of the worker, against the government that sends weapons and cuts the expense Social, struggle in factories for wage increases in the paycheck against the owners of the masters of the masters as in the Rocca case. The workers must unlike other sectors fighting in a single class front, against the Dipadron and Government front, to change the relationships of strength, and advance in the common across the capacity which is the entire system of the masters that generates, war, misery and repression that must be overcome. </p>

<p>It was published in connection with the US Defense Minister of the Minister of Defense Austin's visit to the Philippines earlier this week. </p>
<p>The new agreement thus entails a significant extension of the so-called-nenhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement Agreement(EDCA)which was entered into by the Central countries in 2014. </p>
<p>The Philippine authorities insist that it is not about establishment bases, but call it rather "places", so as not to get into the all -raised light on their own constitution, which prohibits other states' establishment of immilitary bases in the country. </p>
<p>However, the goal from the point of view of Yankee imperialism is clear, namely to stepping the military presence in the South China Sea and intensify the political and military pressure on Chinese imperialism. </p>
<p>The new agreement has led to demonstrations in the capital Manila Dast students and anti-imperialist activists demanding a stop on the Yankee imperialist "Military Aid" and the EDCA agreement being scrapped. </p>

<p>_We officers a call for a rally in Hamburg that was sent to us, and after the brief events of IMBRASILIAN state, we were added to us an addition of the "federalis against imperialist aggression". About the events in Mexico and Brazil have published information from the comrades on site: <a href="https://www.demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/42-nachrichten/lateinamerika/7461-uebersetzung-massaker-in-nova-mutum-ro-neue-berichte-denunzieren-folterungen-und-verletzungen-der-rechte-waehrend-des-angriffs-der-militaerpolizeials-ausdruck-des-proletarischen-internationalismus-aus-solidaritaet-zu-dem-kampf-des-brasilianischen-volkes-u">here</a>and here](https://www.demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/42-nachrichten/lateinamerika/7456-mitteilung-nach-der-aggression-gegen-rincon-tagolaba-tehuantepec). _ </p>
<p>Update: </p>
<p>In the meantime, news from a new massacre of poor farmers in the Brazilian state of Rondonia, once again arranged by large local landowners. The "League of poor farmers"(LCP)Fights in the region for a stucco country for all arms and rural farmers from whom they can provide themselves and their families. Again and again there are massacres through the Brazilian state, the large landowners and henchmen. We therefore call all friends of the Brazilian people and Derlcp to take part in the rally and re -denounce this murders!</p>
<p>End to the criminalization of the struggle for ground!</p>
<p><strong> rally: Wednesday, February 8, 2023 | 6pm | S-Bahn station Sternschanze </strong> </p>
<hr />
<p>In the state of Oaxaca in the Suden Mexico, the poor farmers have been fighting against mega projects since the old state has been building in cooperation with Den imperialists. The farmers are robbed of their land so that huge wind farms can be pulled up on the ISTHMus von Tehuantepec. In this way, Diebauer is expropriated, nature is destroyed and the population is sold. </p>
<p>The resistance, which the farmers have been providing for years, is answered by the Altenmexican state and its henchmen with repression and terrorist. In order to break the struggle of the farmers and the different popular movements that have taken on the task of developing resistance to die -pericalist mega projects, the state is rushing paramilitary gangs on the population. This situation has turned drastically in the last weeks. Several camphor of the people were arrested or disappeared without a trace. On January 29, 2023, armed paramilitars occupied the municipality of Rincon TagolaBedholten the residents, destroyed attachments and drinking water smoke and gifts for switching off. The national police jerked, but did nothing against the heavily armed paramilitars. </p>
<p>The Mexican state uses the murder gangs to work for him at the expense of the people's interests at the expense of the people at the isthmus of Vontehuantepec and there is every means. Our solidarity gilt the fighting poor farmers and the popular movements, such as the people's electricity red sun(Corriente del Pueblo Sol Rojo)that fought immuridically and ready for the necessary things and interests of the people. We demand the release of all detained camphor of the people. We call for dieso -future lively prasement of the disappeared. We are calling for an end to the repression and terror of the old Mexican state and its hand. </p>

<p><strong> why we find it in some steps of the MFPRResell'Assage of the Beretta workers who took place on October 28th in Trezzo. </strong> </p>

If all struggle struggle, make every fight the struggle of all, this is the real and concrete message from other workers and workers. </p>
<p><strong> This assembly of workers, who do not delegate, who take their organization in Loromani as workers and as women, who affirm the autonomy of women so that their direct protagonism is real, </strong> is a novelty in the class union landscape and in Movement of theonnas, an important stage of a path started for about two years with the experience of the Women /Workers 'Shareholders' Meeting. </p>
<p><strong>(ANNUNCIAMO CHE LA PROSSIMA ASSEMBLEA DONNE/LAVORATRICI NAZIONALE IN FORMATELEMATICA SI TERRA' IL 23 FEBBRAIO ORE 17, ALL'0DG SOPRATTUTTO LAPREPARAZIONE DELL'8 MARZO DELLE DONNE PROLETARIE)</strong> </p>
<p>Today this road is all the more necessary in the face of the new Meloni Nerogoverno of the most reactionary right of the bourgeoisie in power. </p>
<p>The struggle of the workers of Beretta <em>(iniziata da vari mesi, fino a quellapiù recente del 1 febbraio)</em> Increase other workers and concerns right -hand rights of working women, the right to maternity, all -sizes, against the discrimination that also exploit the dimymigrated condition of these workers, to impose worse working conditions, dislation, Serie A and Serie B workers, too, too if they do the same job. </p>
<p>The workers' assembly also sets on the plate the question of the march in most proletarian women, workers, workers, that is, women who organize themselves and fight, even if these struggles start from aspects that are immediate - the salary, the hours, the hours, the Health and safety -they are close to the whole condition that concerns us comedian, and therefore inevitably there is an intertwining between the work that we do the factory and the care work that is downloaded to us totally out of the factory, in the family. </p>
<p>So this extra gear is necessary, in particular in this phase, to percontract the government of the owners who took office and which has different issues on the agenda, against workers' struggles, against immigrants, in the general trend of the bourgeoisie to modern fascism , that diavising in the attack on proletarian women, the workers to be exploited more in the factory for the profit of the capitalist masters. Only for Fareun Centno, one of the ministries, the Mise, the Ministry of Economic Development, is in the Ministry of Companies, that is, declaredly at the service of the Dedadroni(in senso nazionalista e corporativo); While there will be the Ministry of Family, born, equal opportunities. But which family, birth rate, equal opportunity, if the workers are attached in basic rights such as Lamaternity, while on the other side they prepare to attack the abortion/ iliDitto to the freedom of choice of us women? </p>
<p>We don't have to stay sun, this is what the masters want, that moreover and oppress us always tend to divide us, isolate us, to put the others, weaken us, suffocate the struggles, repress them in any formal questioning their production, that is, that of the profit cheli enriches. </p>
<p>So this assembly that starts from the struggle of the workers of Beretta Ditrezzo, is not alone, therefore, of Trezzo, is an assembly that concerns us all.</p>

<h1>While the policy that gives birth to fascism lives and reigns, the promoted electoral exclusion of the Golden Dawn fragments and the &#171; democratic &#187; Study of the government, puts new reactionary &#171; deposits &#187; - KKE (M-L)</h1>

<p>Description: The ND government brings to the House of Representatives (amendment) to the exclusion of parties, coalitions of parties and persons who have been convicted of criminal activity.

<p><img alt="" src="Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-05T99-00-00-04-00/antifa.jpg" />The ND government brings legislation to Parliament for immediate vote(τροπολογία)The exclusion of parties, coalitions of parties and persons have been convicted of criminal activity. The debate over whether and how it can and how it can be excluded from the elections of the new Nazis Kassidiaris party has been gone. </p>
<p>It is obvious that what the government is really cut for is the elective percentage of the successors of the neo -Nazi, fascist, terrorist army of the Golden Dawn, and not for its reactionary, anti -labor, racist and anti -populist ideology and practice. After all, it is the ND itself that has incorporated into its series of far -right, basilica, junta and fascist executives and members. It is itself pushed to the fascism of public and political life: it hits open-ended rights and political freedoms, imposes a regime of wild-term and repression, hardens daily to deal with the acting-lacquer and youth, It is the same as giving it and legitimizes the most extreme and dark views. </p>
<p>So no illusion can fit into the motives of this legislative life. Because whenever the forces of the system(και ειδικά στησημερινή συγκυρία)They talk about "protection of democracy", the people must be the worst. The fact that the promoted layout is with such a physician written that it can include a wide range of left -wing policies(που θα μπορούσαν να θεωρηθούν εκτός του αστικούλεγόμενου “δημοκρατικού τόξου”), is indicative of the more overall intended system. Because one issue is the avoidance of the electoral fragmentation of bourgeois political bloc at a time that must be promoted without even more extreme, anti-populist and anti-labor policies, but even more so that it is even further restricted to those voices that have been in popular-work-workers. That Terubarbar Policy. </p>
<p>So, through this legislative provision, the government and the system they save want to put deeper anti -democratic "legacies". They want obstacles to the function and political action of the left -wing and especially those with communist reference. They want to reproduce the reactionary equation of fascist sermons with Tommunist ideals. They want to restore the reactionary theory of the "two -room". As is the case in several countries in the world, with a ban on communist parties and youth organizations and their symbols. </p>
<p>There can be no confidence in SYRIZA and PASOK, given theolithic in their government's service and the government's substantial support for the passage of the foreign and local -headed policy against the popular masses. Regardless of the manipulations they will follow, their targeting is in the ballot box and not in the rights of Tulau and youth. It is in their attempt to display a more "democratic" profile, while they do not minimize the core of the system's attack. </p>
<p><strong> Fascism crushes in the workers', popular and youth struggles. </strong> He crushes in workplaces, neighborhoods, schools and schools. Still systemicide, the native-born of the rotten capitalist-imperialist system. This is what needs to be hit, against it we must and we all be fed.</p>

<h1>AND Weekly Editorial &#8211; The mathematics of capitulation to the militaristic reactionaries</h1>

<h2>AND Weekly Editorial - The mathematics of capitulation to the militaristicreactionaries</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL/2023-02-05T99-00-00-04-00/editorial-mathematics....jpg" />Much noise was made when Luiz Inácio fired, on the 21st, some 80 militarypersonnel serving at the Planalto and the then Army Commander, Júlio César deArruda, replacing him with Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva. Some, dizzy with theblind belief in the "stability" of bourgeois democracy and the country'srotten institutions, and that Yankee imperialism "will not permit a coup,"went so far as to proclaim that the effective "Lula government" was beinginaugurated, without the tutelage of the Armed Forces. Luiz Inácio proclaimedthat he distrusted the Armed Forces, that he wanted a Cabinet of InstitutionalSecurity(GSI)without military staff, and played games for the audience thathe would not accept military assistants(and soon after, would have them), ina staging that he would not submit to "military power," to try to restrict thegenerals' room for maneuver through isolation in public opinion.</p>
<p>On the 31st, "surprising" a total of zero politically aware people, LuizInácio nominated 122 military personnel to the GSI. The maths is clear:instead of restricting the presence of the militaries and, therefore, theirinfluence in the government, the president of the republic increased it!Meanwhile, the press reports that the PT president gave the army permission toprevent the Military Police of the Federal District from acting, on the nightof January 8, against the encampment, at the Army Headquarters. The episode,which involved manoeuvres with tanks by the armed force to dissuade theMilitary Police, was approved by Luiz Inácio, in the face of pressure from thegenerals. As is well known, this manoeuvre was carried out so that active andreserve officers and their families could leave the camp and not be arrested.</p>
<p>Now, what does this reveal? That the performance of a strengthened LuizInácio, who makes it happen with the military, lasted less than a soap bubble,since the alleged strength attributed to the government is a chimera, anillusion. The opportunists and liberals do not see that the defence of thiscorrupt and permissive bourgeois democracy with all kinds of violence againstthe people does not move them, on the contrary, it provokes in them repulsionand, above all, distrust and anger. They pretend not to know, but they knowvery well that in politics the effective force are the masses, and not thenotes from entities and offices, innocuous when they have no material support.But they want to believe this and try to fool the masses into believing thisfantasy too.</p>
<p>To the extent that the government tries to restrict the coup movement withcabinet agreements and grandiloquent declarations about "democracy" - this,unknown by the great masses in their daily lives - it only makes itself inept,while the real force is increasingly with the generals(today, the troops and,now, they are playing to win over the masses, mainly the small and middlebourgeoisie and counting on the Bolsonarist evangelicals among the poor). Thegovernment is leaning towards capitulation; after all, how could it beotherwise, if since the 2018 elections they have been silent about themilitary's constant coup pronouncements? Not a single criticism, onlyappeasement!After all, what can the government of the reactionary coalition,in which the big bourgeois and landowners, servants of imperialism, exercisepower? If it had a modicum of decency it would have immediately called on themasses to take to the streets in defence of threatened democratic freedoms!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indigenous people are being killed, as in the horrific and criminalcase against the Yanomami, and peasants are systematically slaughtered intheir just struggle for land. On the morning of 28 January, police from BOPE,the Rondônia Military Police, shot peasants who were climbing into a boat tocross a river; the soldiers arrested two young people, dragged them to adeserted place, tortured them, even cutting out the tongue of one of them, andthen executed them in cold blood. The press monopolies, the illustriouspoliticians and institutions of justice, heroes of the defence of thisdemocracy, are completely silent. This has nothing to do with your democracy,does it?
The ACFA is calculating and reformulating its plans for military interventionevery day, looking for the right time to intervene, encouraging smalldestabilizations using the "green chickens" as a cannon fodder, and soonsigning new agreements with the government in which it is strengthened in therole of the mediative power [ <em>Poder Moderador</em> ] ; meanwhile, it is trying togain support from its Northern master and backing from public opinion to tryto crush the people's uprising the instant it raises its righteous anger.</p>
<p>To stop the coup in motion, it is impossible to count on the opportunistaristocracy, intoxicated by decades of conviviality in palaces of the oldstate and expectations of reigning for many more. The least that can be doneis to support the masses, mobilising them for their minimum rights, trampledon on a daily basis, through strikes, land seizures, occupation ofuniversities and schools, in a torrent of protests and revolutionarystruggles; without a drop of illusion with the democracy of the rich.</p>
