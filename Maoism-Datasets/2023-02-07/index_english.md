![](Images/DEM VOLKE DIENEN/2023-02-06T23-58-01-00-00/türkei-erdbeben-januar-2023.png)We officially manage an unofficial translation of partizan about the earthquake in Turkei. __DiewEbsite [avrupahaber.org](http://www.avrupahaber.org/)Illustrated the clarification of our comrades from the Turkei. _

According to the Afad, the earthquake of the ST Arke 7.7 at 04.17 p.m. in the Pazarcık district of Maraş, and there were dozens of ablomies, the strongest of Denendas had the strong 6.6. Numerous building collapsed in the earthquake, which was covered in 10 provinces. Hundreds of people live lost and many were injured. While the rescue rests for the trimmer enclosed, a further earthquake of the strong 7.5 with a focus on Maraş Ekinozu-Gozpınar occurred occurred during the trimmer.

_Partizan gave a explanation after the earthquakes. The complete explanation sounds as follows: _

** Although the earthquake is a natural event, the result of the order of the exploitation is destroyed and death, **

Let us strongly organize the solidarity of the people and organize the fight against the exploitation regulations!

Our people are facing another large earthquake disaster. Our people who have lost their families who are waiting for their families, whose homes have been destroyed, need one -sized solidarity that must be organized.

The earthquake, the epicenter of which was in the Pazarcık district of Maraş, caused destruction in Antakya, Osmaniye, Antep, Urfa, Amed, Malatya, Kilis, Adıyaman and Adana. The earthquake, which was also covered in many neighboring provinces, occurred at 04.17 a.m. According to the information, hundreds of people were killed by the earthquake and thousands were violated. The statements made show that the balance of the earthquake is the official statements. There are many villages and cities, especially in rural areas, which have not yet been reached.

Although the earthquake occurred within seconds, its effects last for years. We know that only the solidarity of the people of the people can alleviate diezerstorung and the consequences of the earthquake. It is clear that the classes that have the system are not interested in the losses of the people and will try to take advantage of these large disasters of their own class interests. Your previous practice has shown that you will organize a photo competition on the eve of the elections in order to win more votes. These facts show that the owners of the system will not offer the people. With this awareness, one should deal with the earthquake and organize the solidarity from the regions in which there were never any quakes.

As we know from the earthquakes in Erzincan, Çankırı-Kastamonu, Golcuk, van, İzmirund most recently Elazığ, is not only the nature responsible for this, which cause great suffering. The destruction of this earthquake is a consequence of the excessive greed for profit, which from the exploration of the natural results. The burger-feudal order is responsible for this. The cadastrophe has the life of our people, which they try to maintain under large -scale difficulties. We share the losses and suffering of our people as a result of the earthquake and calls our entire people to organize themselves against this system, causes the substraction and massacre to strong the solidarity of the people.

Although the earthquake is a natural disaster and the result of the movement, the fact that earthquakes and natural events cause such severe remarks are only a product of the imperialist capitalist system. Building and downsizing, which from the exploitation of nature, life and the people to achieve more professional results, have previously given humanity great disasters. Although nature catastrophes are inharent, the resulting destruction is system -related. The conversion of natural events in disaster. The people are realized by the system. The poorest layers of the company are most strongly affected by these disasters. In Denarmenviertel, in makeshift accommodation, without any kind of human living conditions, our people experience these disasters in the most impressive way. With this awareness, it is a response to revolution to organize the solidarity of the people in the regions made by the disaster, to organize the struggle of the people against the state's struggle and solidarity propaganda.

We call on all democratic mass organizations and our organization power to act with a perspective that organizes the solidarity in all possible areas to organize the solidarity of our people and to raise their anger.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-11-42-00-00/ablogo.png)Myanmar's armed resistance against the military is intensified as it enters the third year of its brutal rule.

On February 1, it was reported that up to 43 armed Hunta forces were killed in the Mandalay, Sagaing regions and waves, in just three days.

These include several Tatmadaw commanders who were ambushed on the highway in the town of Sagshwebo, Sagaing region, using landmines. In an interview with one of the ambush conducts, they used landmines that were their own work. Although the operation was dangerous because they had to stick to the same force, the 11-person Tim was able to do the offensive for the injury. Thirteen hunts were killed and six were injured.

Five more Hunta forces in the town of Ayadaw in the same region were killed after the bombs hit their checkpoint and detachment with a drone. A 4-person Tim conducted a drone strike that dropped eight bombs. With the exception of five dead, 10 more forces were injured.

Still in the Sagaing, two Hunta forces were killed and many were injured in three separate raids at the detachment and police station. Two others were killed and many were also injured when armed citizens ambushed the 60-person unit of Tatmadaw of 18 landmines.

Landmines were also used by armed citizens in Nitosa and Mandalay operations.

Meanwhile, the military has expanded its reign for six months. This is contrary to its promise to hold an election to rebuild the civilian government a year after a school -to -stand state on February 1, 2021.

This coup placed Gen. Min aung hlaing, the leadership of the coup. The military again imprisoned Aung San Suu Kyi who was then a civilian government leader.

Although the election is held, many fear that it will only use the hunt to legitimize military rule. This is because it condemned the Aung San Suu Kyi's imprisonment for up to 33 years in the end of the hunt against him. Penalties were awarded to secretly anomalous proceedings.

Under the brutal military hunt, the people of Myanmar suffered severe terrorism and stress. In the last two years, nearly 3,000 civilians have been killed by the Hunta, most peaceful protests. More than18,000 were imprisoned for their opposition to the coup and insist that the elected offices were restored and the civil rights of the people.

In the countryside, the bomb drop from the air that killed as well as children and adults. Among the worst of the Tatmadaw bombing at a school in September 2022 that killed at least 11 young students. This was followed by a bombing of a folk consumer who killed 50 people and injured 70 others.

The burning of households and the eviction of communities is also widespread. Thousands of citizens, mostly from the national minority, were forced to cross the borders to Thailand and India for the inauguration.

Despite the sensational violation of the Hunta to human rights international humanitarian laws, it is continued to be supported by imperialist corporations, including the giant Natotal oil companies.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-12-35-00-00/20230207_durante-1024x767.jpeg )The military and police did not deny Brig.Gen's crime. Jesus Durante III, commander of the 1001st Ibde, after the evidence of the evidence was exposed to Yvonne Chua-Laze, a businessman. The five elements of the 1001st Ibde involved in the killings have taught the brain of crime. Chua-Laza was shot in front of his home on December 30, 2022.

With the exception of Durante, his vice commander Colonel Michael Licyayo and five other soldiers were involved in the crime. Earlier, Chua-Laza's relatives and friends released the message exchanges on the phone because he and Durante, as well as photos of the businessman who had a bruised face and arms. In his messages, he openly named Sidurante who beat him.

Chua-Laza's posts include the threat that he will reveal the act of the military murder of Menardo Villanueva(Ka Hi)and Chad Booc.As, he has a lot of evidence of Durante himself to Villanueva Athbooc. He put a picture of Ka Bok's corpse in his post and he had many similar pictures, he said.

Durante was appointed commander of the 1001st IBDE in August 2021, after serving as the chief of the presidential security group of the president Nasi Rodrigo Duterte. Prior to that, he served in the 1st Scout Ranger Battalion, athepe of Task Force Davao.

#### Bloody liar

On February 24, 2022, Durante boasted the killing of 1001st ibde with teacher Chad Booc and Gelejurain Ngujo, along with civilians Eelgyn Balonga, Tirso Añar and Robert Aragon in New Bataan, Davao de Oro. In an encounter, the local army unit has denied that a Salugar clash took place. Booc's body came out of the autopsy that he was killed.

Durante also announced the lies that died in the encounters of three party cadres in the Southern Mindanao Region in2022.

Villanueva was one of them who was killed in Barangay Libudon in Mabini, Davao de Oro on January 5, 2022. In fact, December 2021 is still holding 1001stibde Villanueva. He was hidden and tortured before he was killed and was killed. The executioners also killed Sandra Reyes(Of)which is estimated to be captured with Ka Bok.

Another disgusting case of Durante and the 1001st Ibde was the abduction, concealment and later killing of Ezequiel Daguman(Ka Rey)Noangmarso 2022.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-13-45-00-00/20230207_reused-sahod.jpg )The High Level Tripartite Mission accompanied by various activities of unions, associations and organizations of employers(HLTM)ngInternational Labour Organization(ILO)in the Philippines on January 23-26. The mission aims to investigate the violations of the rights of employees in the country.

HLTM was launched after workers in 2019 called for at least 380 cases of attacks on unionists, organizers. After more than two years of refusing the Dutertena regime to accept HLTM, it has been pushed to continue this year.

In the Center for Trade Union and Human Rights(CTUHR), at least 56 employers were killed under the Duterte regime. These include Davao de Oro, Negros Island, Bikol and Southern Tagalog. Meanwhile, two workers' organizers have been abducted by state forces and to this day have not been appeared. More than 30 unions were victims of the armed forces of the state and the NTF-ELCAC of red-tagging, intimidation and forced expulsion from their union center.

In Marcos Jr.'s more than six months in power, there are 29 cases of bullying and intimidation among workers, four cases of illegal arrests and filing of fabricated cases. The case of the abduction of two workers' organizer in Cebu was also recorded. Currently, 27 unionist defenders of workers' rights are confined and facilitating fabricated cases.

#### Unity and actions of workers

Before the ILO official arrived, the May Uno movement conducted(SME)the consultation with the workers in Visayas(Iloilo, January 5), Mindanao(Daulo, Enero 7)at Luzon(Laguna, January 10). Pinagtibay sa mga pagtitipong ito angpakikipagkaisa nila sa imbestigasyon ng ILO.

Kaugnay ng misyon, binuo ang All Philippine Trade Unions na kinabibilangan ngpinakamalalaking sentrong unyon gaya ng KMU, Federation of Free Workers,PSlink, Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, Partido Manggagawa, Bukluranng Manggagawang Pilipino, Sentro ng mga Nagkakaisa at Progresibong Manggagawa,Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura, All Workers Unity.

Nagtipon din ang mga unyon ng mga kawani ng gubyerno at binuo ang AllPhilippine Public Service Unions para igiit ang karapatan sa pag-uunyon,benepisyo at pagbabasura sa kontraktwalisasyon. Nagsama-sama dito ang hindibababa sa 12 pambansang sentrong unyon sa pampublikong sektor.

Inilatag naman ng mga manggagawang pangkalusugan noong Enero 22 ang kanilang10-puntong rekomendasyon para kilalanin at itaguyod ang kanilang mgakarapatan. Iginiit naman ng mga guro na kilalanin ang kanilang karapatan sapag-uunyon at dagdag-sweldo.

Magkakasunod na protesta ang inilunsad ng mga grupo sa paggawa sa pambansangupisina ng Department of Justice at Department of Labor and Employment saMaynila. Sa mismong araw ng pagsisimula ng ILO-HLTM noong Enero 23, sinalubongng pagkilos ng daan-daang mga manggagawa ang delegasyon nito sa Makati City.Nagprotesta rin ang mga manggagawa sa Bacolod City, Cebu City at Davao City.

####  Rekomendasyon ng misyon

Matapos ang imbestigasyon, itinulak ng ILO ang gubyerno ng Pilipinas naresolbahin ang maraming kaso ng ekstrahudisyal na pamamaslang sa mgamanggagawa at pagdukot sa mga unyonista at organisador. Anang misyon, "dapatbigyang prayoridad ang kriminal na imbestigasyon at…pagpapanagot." Maaariumano itong pangunahan ng isang komisyon na inirekomenda nitong buuin.

Pinuna ng misyon ang pagdadawit ng estado sa kilusang manggagawa sainsurhensya. Anila, ito'y labag sa batas at nagpapairal ng kultura ng kawalangpakundangan at tahasang lumalabag sa kanilang karapatang mag-unyon.

Hinimok rin nito ang gubyerno ng Pilipinas na palakasin ang mga mekanismo ngmga ahensya ng gubyerno para tiyakin ang kagalingan ng mga unyon atprotektahan ang mga karapatan sa pag-uunyon. Dapat umanong aksyunan ito nggubyerno at magsumite ng ulat sa darating na Hunyo 5.

Ikinalugod ng All Philippine Trade Unions ang pagkilala ng ILO HLTM sa mgadinaranas ng mga manggagawa at unyon sa bansa. Anito, palalakasin pa nila angpagkakaisa ng mga unyon at manggagawa para igiit sa gubyerno ang pagkilala sakanilang mga karapatan, trabaho at sahod. Magbabantay sila hanggang sa araw nahiniling ng ILO na mag-ulat ang gubyerno sa kanila.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T00-13-58-00-00/20230207_reused-ofws-843x1024.jpeg )Sally was one of the migrant workers who had just arrived from Kuwait. Before she could go home, she stayed at a "shelter" or Philippine gem that was built to catch the victims of humantrafficking while processing their return home to the Philippines. He came home without anything, because his boss didn't even bother him.

More than 400 migrants are in the shelters of the Philippine embassy Sakuwait, Sally said. The process of returning home, he said, and the migrants there were as crowded as locals. They are suffering from inhuman conditions of the shelter. Those in the Shelter, so many Filipino migrants are still in the Kuwait cages because they have evacuated their employers and other violations of Kafala's systemic violations.

Sally appeared at a press conference of the Migrante group and church members on January 27 after news of brutal came out of another Filipino housemate on January 18. His employer's son raped and killed Jullebee Ranara, 35-year-old. Burned his body into the desert.

In front of the cameras and microphones, the state's support, from the President to the Depatment of Migrant Workers and OWWA. Behind this, thousands of Filipino migrants have been abandoned by the state in brutal and humanitarian conditions in the Middle East. Since 2017, 6,000 cases of abuse of Filipino workers have been recorded. About 126 have been killed here since 2016. Among them are Joanna Daniela Demafelis(2018), Constancia Lago Day(2019), that jeanelyn villa(2019).

Ayon sa United Methodist Church, mula nang mabalita ang pagpatay kay Ranara,di bababa sa 10 dating nagtrabahong kasambahay sa Kuwait na biktima rin ngpanggagahasa ang dumulog sa kanilang upisina. Nakauwi man silang buhay saPilipinas, ni isa sa kanila ay hindi nakatanggap ng anumang tulong mula sagubyerno.

####  Brutalidad at modernong pang-aalipin

Sa taya ng grupong Migrante, umaabot sa 15 milyong Pilipino ang nasa ibayongdagat. Nagpapadala ang mga overseas Filipino workers (OFW)of remittances forming 8.9% of gross domestic product or GDP. Majority of them are women(59.6%)But they have smaller remittances(44.47%)Because their wages are often low and low. Most of them are housemates and some are cleaner or salesman.

In the Middle East, the number of Filipino workers in Saudiarabia, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. In these countries, similar to all the states in the region except in Iraq, the system exists. This system is also known as the "sponsorship system," in which the state allows individuals or companies to directly obtain an employee. Answer everyone who employs the cost of contractual workers. In exchange, he holds not only the livelihood, but the life of the worker. Contractual migrants do not move to work, it is also illegal for him to just leave or go home.

As a result of this system, migrant workers are experiencing low wages, inhuman employment conditions, abuser and sensational crimes. Violence against women workers is widespread, including rape. In fact, Kafala serves as a system of modern slavery.

In 2022, of nearly 6,000 cases of mistreatment and abuse against the Cooling workers recorded in the PSA, 5,201 were from the Middle East. Only 200 of these were filed in the courts.

#### sales like meat

Not only is the Kafala and Criminal System and abusive employers are the poor condition of contractual workers outside the country. The reactionary state of the Philippines is also a guilty of providing the process of sending workers and tolerating the private work of labor and ensuring their well -being. Several repetitions have also proven the government's officials in the government in conjunction with migrants who sought help.Every day, more than 6,000 Filipinos come out of the country to work. As their numbers grow, the state's interest and interest in protecting them will increase.

The migrants criticized the labor export policy and called for it to be released. Instead of selling the workers, the sustainable reintegration program should be urgently outlined with workers. The country greatly benefits the skills and strengths of nurses, teachers, caregivers, and many others forced to work in other countries. At the same time, all contractors are now urgent to bring home overseas and to achieve justice for all victims of mistreatment, abuse and murders.

![](Images/Philippine Revolution Web Central/2023-02-07T01-57-34-00-00/20230207_editorial-cartoon-1024x724.png )It is very clear for Filipino people, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, is currently a puppet state, no difference in his fatherhood: both puppets, fascists, corrupt and pantatus, and no attention to the hunger and struggles.

This is the collective and motivated the people to rise to EDSA over three decades. It is also now who unites them with them to serve and protect their rights and well-being, and their desire for true national freedom and democracy. Such as a dictator, Marcos Jr using the richest and poorest commitment to the ruling class to operate the crisis system of the system and semipyudal in the Philippines.

Marcos Jr in foreign powers and no small obedience is being surrendered to the nation's own and well-being of the power, especially in the US and China.

Neoliberal policies initiated by his father in the 1970s, what was now fulfilled by Marcos Jr. It pushes todo-largalialization of investment and importance in the name of "perfectly opening door." All favor and promises of foreign dagmapatalist, especially the lower bribe of workers and non-billing charges. Foreigners also provide the poor disorder of farmers and minority people, and ridicule the river, river and ocean.

A few decades when those policies worshiped the livelihood, the local production and economy of the Philippines. In the name of saliberalization of importation, foreigners have been released in the country and plea to local production, especially saagriculture. The peasant masses no longer have a hard time because of imported rice, a variety of vegetables, onions, garlic, and though. In the name of deregulation, the freedom of bourgeoisie-compradors of great commercial, and importers and ismagler(that usually both people or their family)to subtra-overlay the price of the exchange.

Over the past four decades, the country's economic production continued to be increased and the country's economy was released. In order to have an explanatory shortage of money due to uneven foreign trade, the country of foreign debt is more dependent on and shipping Filipino abroad to country dollar. How many, about 1/4 of the country's budget is reserved in debt, overwhelmed by people.

Like his father's perverted priority and followed by Marcos Jr's budget, Marcos Jr's budget, education and other social services were lacked. On the other hand, the fund was raised by the Armed Forces of the Philippines(AFP)To buy helicopters and battles, bombs, a warship for a war of being used to suppress, despised and resisted people.

The declaration of Marcos Jr is "friend of all," in fact, eligibility slavery at all. In concrete, he allowed the US plan and military plan to build an additional five other military bases in the AFP military camps in Cagayan, Isabela and Palawan. The US plans to use it as a station of troops and to meet depressed Chinese. Marcos also allowed to make a joint public war and AFP forces. These steps are part of the US military in the Philippines, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and other countries, as it is made by Ukraine for Gerahan Russia.

Meanwhile, Marcos seemed to be held before continuing China in the seven military facilities that were found in the Philippine Sair. More intense, Marcos Angchinese Construction and Communication Corporation, is a company-owned company in Chinese government to pay for corruption. Attachments involved in the hurting seabirds. Marcos urged to expand the operation of the company Sapalipinas, Bugt to further loans from China.Meanwhile, Marcos Jr, the corruption and the corruption of mankind, greater and worse and worsened by the Water of the reactionary state against the people. In the US imperialist violence, the AFP UGPHILIPPINE National Police is afield.(PNP)to suppress the people. Like the Military Law of Marcos the political suppression and anti-insurgency today. It is not possible and no choice in humanitations and international landlords.

Like Marcos SR, the worker, farmer's farmer, ranged under Marcos Jr, while swimming in luxury and luxury bourgeoisations, great bourgeoisations - comprador and foreign dagmapatukatista. In the face of their experienced oppression and exploitation, there is clear no other way for the people but the path of the resistant resistance.

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck in Pazarcık district of Maraş ataround 04:20 on Monday morning, February 6, was felt in Maraş, as well asMalatya, Mardin, Bingöl, Elazığ, Siirt, Sivas, Van, Muş, Bitlis, Hakkari,Adana, Osmaniye, Batman, Urfa, Kilis, Diyarbakır, Antep, Hatay, northern Syriaand Rojava provinces. The earthquake caused extensive damage and loss of life.According to the latest official statements, thousands of people lost theirlives in the Turkish Kurdistan region alone, while around 6,000 people wereinjured. In addition to the destruction of many houses, buildings andhospitals, airports and roads have also been severely damaged, and with theaddition of winter conditions, rescue efforts are becoming even moredifficult. In addition, as the aftershocks continue, new earthquakes areoccurring and there are still many people under the rubble. Rescue and reliefteams have not yet reached many areas, and the people continue rescue effortswith their own strength. Therefore, it is a reality that the number of peoplekilled and injured is much higher than the official figures.

However, the information provided in the media is only within the borders ofTurkey. Moreover, hundreds of people have lost their lives and thousands ofothers have been wounded in northern Syria and the Rojava region... The factthat it is a cross-border and war zone and the difficult weather conditionsmake the problem in the area even bigger...

As ATİK, Yeni Kadın and YDG; first of all, while conveying our get well wishesto our people, we express our condolences to the relatives of those who losttheir lives, we wish a speedy recovery to our injured people and we declarethat we are with them.

We know that; fascists who destroy nature with fixed rent policies that servetheir own interests by increasing exploitation. R.T. Erdogan, the currentrepresentative of the Turkish state, and his cohorts, the AKP + MHPgovernment, will again shed crocodile tears in the face of the catastrophe ourpeople are experiencing today and will say that their pain is great.

Our people living in Kurdistan, which the Turkish fascism only thinks ofduring election periods, have been ignored for years with policies ofannihilation and denial, and their vital resources have been deliberatelydestroyed by war policies. Although Turkey is an earthquake zone, instead ofbuilding earthquake-resistant buildings, those who invite disasters with thezoning policies carried out under the name of "urban transformation" aiming atthe interests of those in power, with buildings built at gigantic heights, aretrying to dampen the reactions of the people by shedding crocodile tears afterthe disasters.

But in vain... They are no longer able to hide the fact that the magnitude ofthe victimization in natural disasters is not natural, and that the only onesresponsible are the state authorities and their interest policies.

##  Let's grow solidarity with the victims of the earthquake!

As the Confederation of Workers form Turkey in Europe(Article), New Women(You defeated), New Democratic Youth(New Democratic Youth), we have started adonation campaign to show solidarity with the victims of the earthquake bothin Turkish Kurdistan and in Rojava and to deliver the campaign directly to thepeople.

We call on all our people, local and migrant democratic forces, especially allour organizations operating in European geographies, to mobilize in the faceof this disaster, to join and strengthen the campaign. Let's bandage thewounds of our people affected by the earthquake together with the donationsyou send to the bank account number we have published below!

Starting to harm the harabas(armyworms). Gabi-gabi ay nag-iispray ngpestisidyo ang mga magsasaka para labanan ang pag-atake ng salot na uod.Mahigit isang daang libong piso ang nagagastos ng magsasaka sa bawat isangektaryang sibuyasan para puksain ang harabas. Wala silang pagpipilian kaysamatunaw ang sibuyas nila sa isang gabi lang na pag-atake ng balasubas naharabas.

Pero may mas matindi pa sa harabas. Nag-aapura ang mga magsasaka na makaanibago Marso, dahil sinisiguro na nilang aabutan ng bagsak presyo ang sibuyas.Ngayon pa lang ay bumaba na ang presyo ng sibuyas sa pamilihan dahil sapagdagsa ng imported na sibuyas. Halos anim na libong metriko toneladangimported na sibuyas ang dumating noong katapusan ng Enero. Ang presyo ngayonsa farmgate ng pulang sibuyas ay ₱180-200 per kilo at ang puting sibuyas namanay ₱100-120 na lang. Ang sabi ng DA inaasahan nilang bababa ang presyo ngsibuyas sa ₱50 per kilo. Paano na si Pedrong magsasaka?

Sa pagharabas at pagdagsa ng imported na sibuyas, paspas naman ang pag-akumulang tubo ng mga komersyante usurero sa kabukiran. Malaganap ang relasyong"pasamà" o samak. Sa komersyante kukunin lahat ng panggastos sa produksyon naiaawas sa aanihin, saka nila paghahatian ng magsasaka ang aning sibuyas. Sikomersyante din ang nagpipresyo sa sibuyas at sa lahat ng kagamitan saproduksyon na ginamit. Habang nabubundat sa yaman ang mgs komersyantengkasabwat sa kartel ng sibuyas, pasamâ ng pasamâ naman ang kalagayan ngmagsasaka.

Ang pyudal na pagsasamantala ang pinakamatinding peste sa sibuyasan na daangtaon ng nagpapahirap sa magsasaka. Demokratikong rebolusyong bayan lamang angtanging makakalutas nito.🔥

In addition, dozens of replicas ones were recorded, before a new earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and there are many people under the rubble. Rescue teams and Aiden’Aid have still not been able to reach many areas, and the people are continuing rescue efforts with their own forces. Covering, it is true that the number of people who have lost their lives and wounded is much higher than the official figures announced.

However, the information disseminated in the media remains only in the interior of the borders of Turkey. In northern Syria and La Rangion of Rojava, hundreds of people lost their lives and thousands of others were injured ... In addition to being a cross -border and Deguerre area, difficult weather conditions aggravate the problem in the region.

Like Atik, new woman and YDG; First of all, while transmitting our expense to our people, we share their pain, express our condolences close to those who have lost their lives, wish a speedy recovery to our wounded and declare that we are by their side.

We know that the Turkish fascist state, which destroys nature with its pension politics which serve its own interests, increasing the exploitation. The current representative of the fascist state, R.T.ERDOğan and Deses collaborators AKP + MHP will once again shed tears from the catastrophe that our people are experiencing today and will say that.

Our people living in Kurdistan of Turkey, whose fascism only comes to the Esprit in the electoral period, has been ignored for years with the Politics of Destruction and Negation, and its vital resources have been destroyedly destroyed by war policies. Despite the fact that Laturquie is a seismic zone, instead of building pestism buildings, those who invite disasters with the policies of de -construction carried out under the name of "urban transformation" aimed at the interests of power, with buildings established in enormous heights, try to rally the reactions of the population by shedding tears of crocodileapre disasters.

But in vain ... they are no longer able to hide the fact that the extent of the lavictimization in natural disasters is not natural and that the responsible Lesseuls are the agents of the state and their policies of interest.

Let's strengthen our solidarity with our victims of the earthquake!

[![Turkey - Urgent request for help!We are with our people in the Zonadel earthquake 1](Images/Revolucion Obrera/2023-02-07T07-56-48-05-00/tk.jpg)](https://www.revolucionobrera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tk.jpg)Taken from _ [Maoist Road](https://maoistroad.blogspot.com/2023/02/turkey-urgent-call-for-help-we-stand.html)_

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that shook the Pázrcık district of Maraşhacia at 4:20 p.m. , Bitlis, Hakkari, Adana, Osmaniye, Batman, Urfa, Kilis, Diyarbakır, above, Hatay, Elnorte de Syria and the provinces of Rojava. The earthquake caused great damage and fed of human lives. According to the latest official statements, thousands dependists lost their lives only in the Turkish Kurdistan region, while around 6,000 people were injured. In addition to the destruction, demuchas houses, buildings and hospitals, airports and roads also suffered serious damage and, with the addition of winter conditions, rescue lacquers are becoming even more difficult. In addition, as the stories continue, new earthquakes are taking place and there are still many people under the debris. Rescue and relief teams still come to many areas, and the population continues the rescue work of their own forces. Therefore, it is a reality that the number of deaths and injured is much greater than the official figures.

However, the information provided in the media sealimates to the borders of Turkey. In addition, hundreds of people have lost Lavida and thousands of others have been injured in northern Syria and in the Red Red…. The fact that it is a cross -border and war zone and the different weather conditions make the problem in the area even….

As Ati̇k, Yeni Kadın and Ydg; In the first place, while we transmit our best wishes to our people, we express our condolences to the relatives of those who lost our lives, we wish a prompt recovery of our injured and declare that we are with them.

We know; Fascists who destroy nature with fixed income policies serve their own interests by increasing exploitation. R.T. Erdogan, current representative of the Turkish state, and his henchmen, the AKP + MHP government, will spill tears of crocodile before the catastrophe that lives today and will say that their pain is great.

Our people who live in the Kurdistan, in which Turkish fascism only applies during electoral periods, has been ignored for years of annihilation and denial for years, and their vital resources have deliberately cidodested with war policies. Although Turkey is a seismic zone, instead of building buildings resistant to the matters, those that invite disasters with the zoning policies carried out under the name of "urban transformation" with the objective to reatisfied the interests of those in which they are in Power, with buildings constructed at gigantic heights, are trying to cushion the reactions of people spilling crocodile tears after disasters.

But in vain ... they are no longer able to hide that the magnitude of the victimization in natural catastrophes is not natural, and that the only ones responsible are state authorities and their interested policies.

# HBDH YK: "People's earthquake will destroy the AKP!"

Description: The people began to find the way to remove these wrecks and wrap their pain in their own specificity. Solidarity and anger to the system bring them together. The fascist power and Erdogan once again exhibit in the eyes of the people. Our poor people will surround the pain of this earthquake and ask for an account.

As the saved ones, we will pass our wishes to get past. These painful days, the struggle and the people with their own solidarity will overcome.

This geography is located on the earthquake zone. There are many earthquakes of various sizes. Our memories still maintain its freshness as a result of many earthquakes in different regions. Deaths that exceed thousands of thousands of thousands continue to acquire the grieving history of our people as a bitter reality.

The last earthquake we have experienced has already reached seriousiboyuts with its increasing numbers. In this earthquake, which is compared with many aspects of the ’99 earthquake, more than three,000 people lost their lives and the number continues to increase, there are tens of thousands of wounded and people under tens of thousands of building debris.

The reason for this earthquake is of course due to the movements in the earth's crust. However, large levels of deaths and building debris are fascist power. It is obvious that this fascistdar, based on the order of rent and exploitation all sides, has made a profit with large rent for years. This power and bosses, who establish an order on human labor exploitation, rapid profit-rent providing and ignoring life, are the main reason for deaths. While taking precautions in palaces, villas, mansions; The fact that no precautions are taken in the poor and laborer neighborhoods, apartments and slums continues to increase these deaths. Every side of this rotten fascist power goes back and over again. The demolished cities have become a grave of our people who have nothing else when they work with their labor. This fascist power, which is to make the rich more rich in power, will continue to disregard human deaths while continuing to protect these regulations. While our people continue to remove their pain under their own efforts, the fascist AKP-MHP power will remain under those debris.

The fascist power has not taken action with any institution. But he started to lie with every institution. The discourses of the people from the earthquake regions of the people do not match any way. Power is experiencing a complete ruler crisis while performing his lies. While only our people have the will of human rescue in the region, a complete chaos is dominant within the state. Fascistdar, who sees the hope of living as the source of their political future, cannot leave this crisis environment. No institution of the state does not reach the search and rescue regions, people are abandoned to death. For the war, the rich people are not delivered to the region when it comes to the poor. In live broadcasts _ “Erdogan says; AFAD was raised. Where did he grow up? ” The fascist power continues to put capital and survivors on its route. This earthquake is trying to get out of the political consequences for themselves and the bosses. However, the profit of the fascist power will continue to collide with the pain of the people. It will be our winning people.

The people have started to find the way to lift these wrecks and wrap their pain at their own specificity. Solidarity and anger to the system bring them together. Fascist power and Erdogan once again exhibit in the eyes of the people. Our poor people will surround the pain of this earthquake and ask for an account. The earthquake of the people will destroy the Palaces of the AKP, the Palaces of the AKP.

Long live the solidarity of the people!

Long live the organized struggle of the people!

Down with the boss!

Damn AKP-MHP fascism!

_We publish an updated call to the rally of the BGIA Hausamburg next Wednesday ._

** Stop the terror against the Mexican people!**

### ** stops terror against the poor farmers in Brazil!**

In the state of Oaxaca in the Suden Mexico, the poor farmers have been fighting against mega projects since the old state has been building in cooperation with Den imperialists. The farmers are robbed of their land so that huge wind farms can be raised on the isthmus of Vontehuantepec. In this way, the peasantry, nature is destroyed and the population is sold.

The resistance that the farmers have been providing, on the other hand, is answered by the Altenmexican state and its henchmen with repression and terrorist. In order to break the struggle of the farmers and the different popular movements that have taken on the task to develop resistance to die -pericalist mega projects, the state is rushing paramilitary gangs to be populated. This situation has turned drastically in the last weeks. Several camphor of the people were arrested or disappeared without a trace. On January 29, 2023, armed paramilitars occupied the municipality of Rincon TagolaBedholten the residents, destroyed attachments and drinking water smoke and gifts for switching off. The national police jerked, but did nothing against the heavily armed paramilitars.

The Mexican state uses the murder gangs to work for him, the interests of the imperialists at the expense of the people at the isthmus of Vontehuantepec through and there is every means for them. Our solidarity gilt the fighting poor farmers and the popular movements, such as the people's electricity red sun(Red Sun People's Current)that fought immuridically and ready for the necessary things and interests of the people. We demand the release of all detained camphor of the people. We call for dieso -future lively prasement of the disappeared. We are calling for an end to the repression and terror of the old Mexican state and its hand.

To this end, news from a new massacre of poor farmers in Brazilian state of Rondonia, once again arranged by large landowners. The two farmers _rodrigo and Raniel were tortured and murdered. Both were found extremely. Raniel's body can be seen in pictures, on which it can be seen that a big stucco of his __Sch nobility_ _ is. _

The league of the poor farmers(LCP)For a long time, fighting in the region for bargain land for all poor and landless farmers that they can care for themselves and their families. Again and again there are massacres through the Brazilian state, the large landowners and their henchmen. In April 2021, the Brazilian state went through a massacre in Santa Elina, in Camp Manoelribero, in which several farmers were murdered. Camp terrorized for days and weekly sausages, isolated and cordoned off from the outside world. The crowd of the poor farmers, which was organized on the land of the poor farmers, was organized on the ground in which the collective life and the collective work of the poor farmers were organized on the ground. Nevertheless, the struggle of the LCP and the farmers organized and landless farmers continued.

Then as now, all friends of the Brazilian people and Derlcp call up to take part in the rally and to dismiss and condemn them again!

** End of the criminalization of the struggle for ground!**

Workers, peasants and peasants and native people have taken the streets and have joined in the fight against elacism, hunger, corruption and exploitation. The government's response these mobilizations has been the fierce and excessive repression of the manifestants with more than 50 dead and 600 wounds and injured. We cannot let it mention that this Government with a National Compound Congress mostly by ultra -right and fujimoristas that have institutionalized the racismodes of the 90s with 217 thousand sterilizations forced to women, peasants and indigenous people being Alberto Fujimori in power.

We greet above all to the thousands of women of the town, we claim fundamental suppress in this struggle as women have had in all the work throughout history.

We want to echo the complaints against the National Police of Peru, for forcing indigenous and peasant women to undress and examine their intimate parties without their consent by arbitrarily detained during the violent unemployment of the San Marcos National University. This type of humiliating acts constitute sexual abuse as a form of torture. We repudiate the repression that the organized people of Peru are suffering, we repudiate latorture that women are suffering today, especially and indigenous peasants. Solidarity with the brother people of Peru.

As of March 8, 2017, the discussion about the role of the variables has been above the table, both its participation in the marches as the declaration of a women's or mixed strike.

From the Women's Movement we claim this day, as a day of struggle in which women are protagonists and in which it must be made visible, they do not solon oppression within the home, having the responsibility of domestic lastbears and care of daughters and sons and the elderly but as part of the exploited working people.

In the representative tables of the PIT CNT, the fight for a great parode women of 24 hours has been given. Gender commissions of different unions have planted for years the need for our convention(in which majority of representatives are men)I proclaim a strike with these characteristics, but they always position themselves against. Even the Secretariade Genre y Equidad, which has a voice but does not vote in the Secretariat, defends the mixed partial general strike to attend the marches that the women's movement with the movement.

This year the characteristics of 8m will be voted in February in the first table present of the year and the feminist intersocial(feminist organization headed by the FA)He has come to the press to inform to fight for Elpit CNT to convene a national unemployment of 24 hours alone.

We understand that March 8 is a day of mobilization and struggle, one day tovoilize the violence we suffer and our more sentenced claims, always claiming the International Day of Working Women, doubly oppressed and exploited.

For years, our forehead has worked to multiply specific spaces in our centers of studies and unions and from there as students and workers, but above all as women of the town, we have impulsed a large unemployment of 24 hours We stop women, we stop the world. ”

It is specifically a solidarity action with the communities of the Papotecs of [Santa Cruztagolaba](https://solrojista.blogspot.com/2022/11/mexico-informe-de-las-marchas.html)and [rintegolaba](https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2023/02/01/comunicado-tras-la-agresion-contra-rincon-tagolaba-tehuantepec/), in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, who live under the attack of the brothers "Tacho Casasta and Sergiocanalla" that command an armed group at the service of the estate to impose interoceanic corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec(Ciit); as well as ensolidarity with the poor peasants of [Rondonia, Brazil](https://resistenciacamponesa.com/luta-camponesa/policia-assassina-camponeses-durante-ataque-contra-familias/), which are constantly victims of armed attacks in the hands of the landowner and the Military Police.

In Mexico and Brazil, the fight for the Earth is being developed Conheroism by the impoverished masses of the countryside, in some places to defend and recover it, and in others to distribute it. In both countries, the reactionary governments support the actions of the landowner, the military police officers and the paramilitarism that all kinds of crimes against the people commit.

This activity convened by the companions of Germany will be carried out on February 8, the day in which the interference audience of the communal companion Zapotec is planned [Salvador Pinalmeléndez](https://solrojista.blogspot.com/2021/12/urgente-el-companero-salvador-pinal.html), who has been a political imprisonment and is under roots to defend the lands of Santa Cruz Tagolaba against theimposition of the CIIT, in Mexico.

The mobilization of Hamburg in solidarity with poor peasants of Mexico and Brazil reflects a high internationalist and proletarian spirit that we recognize and greet.

Next, we share the call of the companions of Germany for mobilization.



** Manifestation in Hamburg: High terror against the Mexican people!Altoal terror against the poor peasants of Brazil!**

We are publishing an updated call for the mobilization of the health against imperialist aggression in Hamburg, next Wednesday.

** High terror against the Mexican people!**

** High terror against the poor peasants of Brazil!**

For years, the poor peasants of the state of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, have resisted the megaprojects that the old state is building encounters with the imperialists. The peasants are being stripped of land so that huge wind farms are built in the stophuantepec isthmus. Peasants are expropriated, nature is destroyed and the population is expressed.

The resistance that peasants have been opposing for years have been in the repression and terror of the old Mexican state and SOSSECUACES. To break the struggle of the peasants and the popular various movements that have given themselves the task of developing the resistance to imperialist megaprojects, the state encourages paramilitary bands on the population. This situation has worsened drastically in the last weeks. Several popular fighters were arrested or missing for leaving a trace. On January 29, 2023, armed paramilitaries tangle the landowners occupied the community of Rincón Tagolaba, threatening the settlers, destroying crops and hoses of drinking water, and shooting intimidating shots. The National Guard intervened, but not hizoned against strongly armed paramilitaries.

The Mexican State, with the help of the murderous bands that work for him, enforces the interests of the imperialists at the expense of the people of the stophuantepec, and resorts to any means to do so. Our solidarity scon the poor peasants who fight and popular movements, such as the Solrojo(Red Sun People's Current), that struggles tirelessly and the needs and interests of the people are sacrificed. We demand the liberation of all people's fighters. We demand the immediate and invited presentation of the disappeared. We demand the end of the repression and terror of the Mexican state and its henchmen.The Liga of Poor Peasants(LCP)She has been fighting for a long time for a piece of land for all poor peasants and sudes that they can keep themselves and their families. One and the other there are massacres by the Brazilian state, the great lands and heavy lands. In April 2021, the Brazilian State carried out a Santa Elena Massacreen, at the Manoel Ribero camp, killing several peasants. The camp was terrified for days and weeks, isolated from the exterior and cordoned world. The entire camp, in which life was organized and the collective work of poor peasants in the lands occupied by them, was razed. However, the struggle of the LCP and the peasants and land without organized in it continued.

So as now, all the friends of the Brazilian people and the LCP call them to participate in the demonstration and denounce and condemn these new ones are in the face!

Stop criminalizing the fight for the earth!

Night event at the Tav construction site in Chiomonte. Marta, a Pisan companion, is stopped by the police after a violent office. Person, insulted and sexually harassed by the police, she is reported.

During the first interrogation of Marta, held by the now famous prosecutors with the Padalino and Rinaudo element, the No Tav movement organizes a Pernon garrison leaving Marta alone to face that difficult moment. A dicompagne group, women, friends decides to bring a banner who, beyond asolidarize with Marta, denounces the police violence. "If they touch all". A gesture of feminist solidarity, against violencemaschile in uniform towards a partner. They do not have time to adapt it to hang it out of the court that the police upload, Manganella Epoi denounces. In a farce process in which the harassment suffered by Marta were removed as well as the reasons for the garrison, the companions are accused of all sorts of crime. The prosecutor points the finger on the "festive climate" of thepresidio to indicate the pretext of the presence of the movement. For the prosecutor women present should have dressed in mourning and cry all their lorolacrime to demonstrate their pain for the victim? A determined reaction part of those women is such an unacceptable and incomprehensible fact? Still, the PM insists with a witness on the fact that, not having suffered the year sexual violence, he could not have understood and therefore solidarized with a woman who instead those violence says he has them suffered. These are only the pearls that they felt during the process.

The sentence? 8 -month sentence for Cecca.

Ten years after that summer.

We learn about the decision of the Turin surveillance court: the judge Elena Bonu decides to serve the sentence in prison.

Unfortunately, for those who do not have a short memory, this judge cheer her to be the same to have chosen the prison for Dana.

Despite the positive opinion of the same Prosecutor General in the face of the enrichiegers of application of the alternative measures to the prison, the Court of disorganization decides, once again, to punish those who fight.

We ask ourselves few things, because we already have the answers.

The simplicity with which their justice can play with the life of theperson, with those who are part of the No Tav movement, with those who fight and with those who have not been in this world is chilling. The fact that it can do it undisturbed, because accepted in all respects by the political, institutional Egyptian institutional apparatus is shameful.

On the part of the Court, of the Prosecutor and the Turin Police Headquarters we live unprecedented and probably unparalleled in this country but, how much, we will resist one meter, a minute more than them. Because we know we have.

Cecca we are and we will always be by your side!

The other worker has been a statosphere from the 118 staff and transported to the hospital in Novi Ligure, he would not in danger of life. These are two employees of the Seloverseas company(Webuild group).

Tra le prime ipotesi, quella di una fiammata dovuta a una fuga di gas mentrescavavano, in un primo momento si è anche parlato di un'esplosione. Gli operaierano nel tunnel di accesso alla grande opera per dei lavori di consolidamentodella galleria. Probabilmente una scintilla partita dal macchinario potrebbeaver innescato il gas naturale, che è monitorato da apposite apparecchiature.

Sono in corso gli accertamenti dei carabinieri di Voltaggio con i colleghi diNovi Ligure per fare chiarezza su quanto accaduto.

I sindacati hanno indetto uno sciopero immediato nel cantiere del Terzovalico. Feneal, Filca e Fillea richiedono un incontro urgente con leprefetture e l'azienda capofila. "Riteniamo assurdo - scrive in una nota laFilca, organizzazione degli edili della Cisl di Alessandria - che unlavoratore venuto tra l'altro dalla lontana Calabria per poter mantenere lapropria famiglia venga strappato ai propri affetti per l'ennesimo, evitabile,infortunio sul lavoro. Stiamo attendendo le valutazioni ufficiali dellecompetenti autorità - aggiunge la Filca - Ma siamo anche fortementepreoccupati della possibilità che ulteriori infortuni di questo genere possanoriprodursi".

** A new report, prepared by the Stine Sofies Foundation, "concludes that children living at a secret address have poor legal protection," reports NRK **

The report "Children's Accident Investigation Board deals with, among other things, children who live faces 6. According to NRK, about 750 children live on code 6 in Norway today. /or is submarine about serious violence.

In other words, the children who live on code 6 are children who have been exposed to a master threatened with violence, or children living in hiding with a parent or other family member who has been exposed to violence or threat. In cases of the perpetrator the children are hiding for is a parent, they can be forced together, even though the threat situation has thus been considered as severe the child lives at a secret address.

Many children live at a secret address precisely because of home violence. The Ir report(s. 41)It says: “It is not uncommon for the children's threat athlete to be one of the parents, and that this is the reason why the rest of the family must be secured under Code 6. It is also not common for an assessment of the threat situation to be done only to the adult. The children become a kind of adhesion, someone who has to join, without being made of single assessment on their behalf. "

Forced togetherness can have tragic consequences. NRK writes about the murder of Tintin Isverige, where the District Court defied the mother's warnings that the ex -husband was violent and decided that his father should have two hours of being together with the eight -year -old. Tintin Bleedpt of her father during his attendance. The murder triggered large demonstrations of ice cube, with demands for legislative change.

In Norway, too, parents must fight to protect children from perpetrator. NRKKRIVER OF A Supreme Court judgment from 2022: "In the judgment, a mother last year had to appeal to the Supreme Court to stop contacting her child and the one who was the war to take her mother."

Care of perpetrator can pose a major security risk for the child and the rest of the family living in code 6 in several ways. Professional leader at Stinesofie's Foundation, Kristin Stokke, told NRK that “It is absurd that children are forced to have contact with a person they are really shielding. During his togetherness, there is a great danger that the child reveals his new identity, "and" to put the responsibility on a child is unreasonable and contradicts all common sense. "

Endre Bendixen, legal adviser to the foundation, told NRK that: "We believe that the general rule cannot be a relationship between the person who performs the threat and those who are protected by the code 6 measure."

The report also problematizes the use of Code 6 as protective measures. The secret address entails major burdens for the threat, but at the time of no reduction in the freedom of the perpetrator. In the report(s.37)It says that "Code 6 limits the child's unfolding and robs the child's unanimous rights," and that "it is clear to us that the burden on the threat situation must be put first and foremost on the wax threat." It is therefore argued that the reverse violence alarm should be used in situations where sufficiently considered.

Earn Folket Media has previously written that “On average 8 women are killed by the partner annually. One in three has tried to get help from the police and every year a woman dies while she waits for the police to risk assess the case. " It has also been written about "desperate women who must let the children be husbanded a serious violence against themselves" in a case of a Norwegian -violence study and that the child welfare service ignores violence against women. That violent and threat children on Code 6 today can be legally forced to be together with the part of the part, and thus also have to live with the burden that they can reveal where the family lives clearly shows that one of society's most vulnerable groups does not rely on state protection ..

![](Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-07T97-00-00-04-00/koritsi.jpg)** The government responsible and the miserable capitalist system serving **

The rape and abuse of the 12 -year -old from Sepolia continues. This administration, by the guardians of state institutions, who made the capitalist system to protect us from criminals. Together, they fled the 12 -year -old in her despair and closed the mother in prison for her to close her mouth.

The mother, since January 25, has begun a hunger strike. She does not want to die, she wants to live for her child who fell victim to miserable prostitution circuits but also for her other seven children. He asks for solidarity.

It is obvious that behind the dirty trafficking circuit, that is, trading human beings and prostitution, co -ordinated in the Sepolia area by Micho, a local ND commander, hiding high -ranking persons, who is not touched by anyone. So they first made sure to get out of the middle by capturing it, to unravel with the main prosecutor, so that their dirt would not go out to the surface. The arrests and the clipping that was made to subdue popular indignation are from Marida. Large fish continue to be fueled by allaps. Corruption and hypocrisy characterize the ruling class, the state and its institutions.

Judges, police officers, journalists, state institutions and NGO representatives, that is, the essentials necessary to support and groom the exploitative social system, provocatively and overtly, each of their posts, attempt to hide the crime and cover them. They set up, slander, target and stigmatize the victims. Because they were unable to close the mouth of the mother and the 12 -year -old, they are still attempting their physical extermination. This inhumane tactic is in their nature. To be in power, they are pressed on the corpses. It won't pass them.

In vain the government is trying to keep distances to hide the guilt. If he did not want to cover up the case, if he was not entangled, he would not. From her force to hunt the case, she does not catch up or nor ash in the eyes. To make, for example, the elementary of the 12 -year -old's training or to display a small excuse for holding the mother and releases mastic, murderers and fascists. He has the main responsibility for the concealment of the victims and the obvious attempt to exaggerate victims.

The horror that the 12 -year -old experienced and continues to live in Sepolia, the agony of the man and the attempt of the needy family to survive the nudity of the society we live in. It is scattered with human tragedies.

The victims of this particular tragedy that is evolving in front of us are demanding our Greek. It is important, in the course of the struggle to revolutionize this unjust society, in the small and the big battles, to save people.

*** To demand immediate mom release!** ** ** To demand that the 12 -year -old be assisted in every way!** ** to demand family support!!**

** It is not enough to make it a matter for the residents of the Sepolia but of the whole people, he is in the unjust, so he recognizes it, who knows how to claim and be judged for justice. **

**WE STAND WITH OUR PEOPLE IN THE EARTHQUAKE ZONE**

The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck in Pazarcık district of Maraş ataround 04:20 on Monday morning, February 6, was felt in Maraş, as well asMalatya, Mardin, Bingöl, Elazığ, Siirt, Sivas, Van, Muş, Bitlis, Hakkari,Adana, Osmaniye, Batman, Urfa, Kilis, Diyarbakır, Antep, Hatay, northern Syriaand Rojava provinces. The earthquake caused extensive damage and loss of life.According to the latest official statements, thousands of people lost theirlives in the Turkish Kurdistan region alone, while around 6,000 people wereinjured. In addition to the destruction of many houses, buildings andhospitals, airports and roads have also been severely damaged, and with theaddition of winter conditions, rescue efforts are becoming even moredifficult. In addition, as the aftershocks continue, new earthquakes areoccurring and there are still many people under the rubble. Rescue and reliefteams have not yet reached many areas, and the people continue rescue effortswith their own strength. Therefore, it is a reality that the number of peoplekilled and injured is much higher than the official figures.

However, the information provided in the media is only within the borders ofTurkey. Moreover, hundreds ofpeople have lost their lives and thousands ofothers have been wounded in northern Syria and the Rojava region…The fact thatit is a cross-border and war zone and the difficult weather conditions makethe problem in the area even bigger…![](Images/ATIK/2023-02-07T98-00-00-04-00/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-07-at-14.35.09.jpeg)As ATİK, Yeni Kadın and YDG; first of all, while conveying our get well wishesto our people, we express our condolences to the relatives of those who losttheir lives, we wish a speedy recovery to our injured people and we declarethat we are with them.

We know that; fascists who destroy nature with fixed rent policies that servetheir own interests by increasing exploitation. R.T. Erdogan, the currentrepresentative of the Turkish state, and his cohorts, the AKP + MHPgovernment,will again shed crocodile tears in the face of the catastrophe our people areexperiencing today andwill say that their pain is great.

Our people living in Kurdistan, which the Turkish fascism only thinks ofduring election periods, have been ignored for years with policies ofannihilation and denial, and their vital resources have been deliberatelydestroyed by war policies. Although Turkey is an earthquake zone, instead ofbuilding earthquake-resistant buildings, thosewho invite disasters with thezoning policies carried out under the name of „urban transformation" aiming atthe interests of those in power, with buildings built at gigantic heights, aretrying to dampen the reactions of the people by shedding crocodile tears afterthe disasters.

But in vain… They are no longer able to hide the fact that the magnitude ofthe victimization in natural disasters is not natural, and that the only onesresponsible are the state authorities and their interest policies.

# Female hatred and capitalist goods production

![](Images/PUNALIPPU/2023-02-07T99-00-00-04-00/romper_las_cadenas.jpg)HS's opinion column has had a debate on men's so-called. about sexual dysfunction and its alleged connection to patriarchal violence. [original writing](https://www.hs.fi/mielipide/art-2000009348479.html)In addition, hson released two counterparts([1](https://www.hs.fi/mielipide/art-2000009357929.html),[2](https://www.hs.fi/mielipide/art-2000009361771.html)).

Mitä on keskusteltu? Alkuperäisessä kirjoituksessa muuan filosofiantutkijatohtori argumentoi pseudotieteellisen niin sanotun seksuaalisuudenmarkkinateorian hengessä, että miesten "seksikumppanien epätasainenjakautuminen" on yhtä voimakasta kuin "varallisuus Gini-kertoimella mitatenepätasa-arvoisimmissa valtioissa", ja väitteen tueksi esitetään kaikenlaisiamukavasti löytyneitä numerotietoja.

Lopuksi kirjoittaja tulee päätelmäänsä: "seksin puutteesta johtuva väkivaltaon alati kasvava turvallisuusuhka". Heti perään hän tosin yrittää lievennelläsanomaansa vakuuttamalla, että jokainen toki saa valita seksikumppaninsavapaasti, mutta tällä tavoin hän tuleekin vain vahvistaneeksi, että hänestäongelma on koko naissukupuolessa. Kirjoitus on alusta loppuun täysintaantumuksellinen.

Entä vastineet? Ensimmäisessä vastineessa UN Women Suomen viestintäpäällikköselittää: "Seksuaalinen ja sukupuolittunut väkivalta johtuvatpatriarkaalisista rakenteista, sukupuolten epätasa-arvosta ja vallanepätasaisesta jakaantumisesta, ei siitä, että miehet eivät saa tarpeeksiseksiä". Tämä on oikein.

Sen sijaan kirjoituksen lopulla ryhdytään laventamaan kysymystä: "Maailma eimyöskään ole jakaantunut vain naisiin tai miehiin, ja on paljon muunlaistaseksiä kuin naisen ja miehen välinen penetraatiokeskeinen heteroseksi". Tämäei ole relevanttia aiheen kannalta, vaan aiheuttaa vain sekaannusta.Yhdysvalloissa keksitty "queer-teoria" asettaa niin sanotun cis-heteronormatiivisuuden samalle viivalle naiston sorron kanssa, ja tällä tavoinheikentää taistelua naisten emansipaation puolesta.

Lopuksi tämä vastine saa hieman koomillisia sävyjä, kun kirjoittaja pohtiikeinoja ihmisten seksielämän parantamiseksi. Tällä tavoin naisten sorron japatriarkaalisen väkivallan arvostelusta astutaan sivupolultakin vielä metsään.

Toisessa vastineessa, jonka kirjoittaja on sukupuolentutkimuksenväitöskirjatutkija, näkökulmana on retoriikan arvostelu. Kirjoituksessakauhistellaan incel-kulttuurin väkivaltaista luonnetta ja äimistellääntaloustieteestä lainattua pseudotieteellistä käsitteistöä, jollaalkuperäisessä kirjoituksessa kuvataan seksiä. Kirjoittaja summaa: "Netinnaisvihamielisestä kulttuurista noukittu sanasto ja kielikuvat ovatvalitettavasti valtavirtaistumassa, eikä tämä missään nimessä ole suotavatrendi".

Ainoa lisä, jota tämä toinen vastine keskusteluun tuo, on retoriikanarvostelun näkökulma, joten on katsottava, että HS on tehnyt julkaisupäätöksennimenomaan siksi. Sen sijaan, että puhuttaisiin naisten sorrosta ja naisiinkohdistuvasta väkivallasta, puhutaankin soveliaasta kielenkäytöstä japropagoidaan idealistista sanamagiaa. Tämä ei ole mitenkään sattumaa, silläjuuri kieli on keskeisiä areenoita, jolla imperialismi lietsoo vilpillistäpolarisaatiota "vaihtoehto-oikeiston" ja uusvasemmiston välillä.

Alkuperäiseen taantumukselliseen kirjoitukseen HS on siis päättänyt julkaistakaksi postmodernismia ja pikkuporvarillista feminismiä edustavaa vastinetta,jotka molemmat palvelevat keskustelun viemistä sivuraiteille naisten sorrostaja naisiin kohdistuvasta väkivallasta. Tämä on hyvä esimerkki siitä, mitenimperialismi kehittää ideologista sotaansa osana yleistävastavallankumouksellista offensiivia, joka epätoivoisesti julistaamarxilaisuuden vanhentuneisuutta. Välittömästi tärkeimpänä taantumuksellisenatoimijana on tässä monopolistinen HS, joka on tehnyt päätökset näidenkirjoitusten levittämisestä. Tällaisia hyökkäyksiä vastaan on meidänvelvollisuutemme puolustaa marxilaista kantaa.

Postmoderni pikkuporvarillinen feminismi, jota imperialismi levittää osanayleistä vastavallankumouksellista offensiivia, hyökkää marxilaistaluokkakantaisuutta vastaan. Tilalle se tyrkyttää intersektionaalisuutta, jokaasettaa eri sorron muodot samalle viivalle, ja näin kiistää proletaarisenvallankumouksen ratkaisevan merkityksen riistosta ja sorrosta vapautumiselle.Filosofisesti se pohjaa idealismiin, kuten kaikki taantumuksellinen.

Entä mistä – marxilaisuuden mukaan – niin sanotussa seksuaalisuudenmarkkinateoriassa on oikeastaan kysymys?

Engels on sanonut: **"** **M** **itä enemmän perinteellinen hetairismi muuttuumeidän aikanamme kapitalistisen tavarantuotannon vaikutuksesta ja mukautuutavarantuotantoon, mitä enemmän se muuttuu avoimeksi prostituutioksi, sitäsuurempaa turmelusta se saa aikaan. "** Tämän hetairismin hän määritteleeseuraavasti: **" Hetairismi on yhteiskunnallinen instituutio yhtä hyvin kuinkaikki muukin; se on entisen sukupuolivapauden jatkumista miehen hyväksi."**

While you have to fight for the oppression of women and all kinds of justice theories, you should not forget the revolutionary struggle for socialism for a moment, for as Engels says, *"The first condition for female freedom is to return the whole female gender to the re -society, which, in turn **.

** We are alongside our people in the Deterre tremor region **

On Monday morning, February 6, around 04:20, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 is approached in the district of Pazarcik, in the province of Kahramanmaras. Enplus de Maraş, it has been felt in many regions such as Quemalatya, Mardin, Bingöl, Elazı, Siirt, Sivas, Van, Muş, Bitlis, Hakkari, Adana, Osmaniye, Batman, Urfa, Kilis, Diyarbakır, antep, the Hatay, North of Lasyria and the Rojava provinces. The earthquake has caused major déses and losses in human lives. According to the latest official statements, thousands of people have lost their lives in the Dukurdistan region of Turkey, while 6,000 people were injured. The rescue efforts become more difficult with the addition of winter and transport difficulties caused By the ladestruction of many houses, buildings and hospitals, as well as the graves of airports and roads. In addition, dozens of replicas ones were recorded, before a new earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and there are many people under the rubble. Rescue teams and Aiden’Aid have still not been able to reach many areas, and the people are continuing rescue efforts with their own forces. Covering, it is true that the number of people who have lost their lives and wounded is much higher than the official figures announced.

However, the information disseminated in the media remains in the interior of the borders of Turkey. In northern Syria and Laragion of Rojava, hundreds of people lost their lives and thousands of others were injured ... In addition to being a cross -border and Deguerre area, difficult weather conditions aggravate the problem in the region.

Like Atik, new woman and YDG; First of all, while transmitting our expense to our people, we share their pain, express our condolences close to those who have lost their lives, wish a speedy recovery to our wounded and declare that we are by their side.

The current representative of the fascist state, R.T.ERDOğan and Deses collaborators AKP + MHP will once again shed tears from the catastrophe that our people are experiencing today and will say that.

Our people living in Kurdistan of Turkey, whose fascism only comes to the Esprit in the electoral period, was ignored for years with Lespolitiques de Destruction and Negation, and its vital resources have been destroyedly destroyed by war policies. Despite the fact that Laturquie is a seismic zone, instead of building pestism buildings, those who invite disasters with the policies of de -construction carried out under the name of "urban transformation" aimed at the interests of power, with buildings established in enormous heights, try to rally the reactions of the population by shedding tears of crocodileapre disasters.

But in vain ... they are no longer able to hide the fact that the extent of the lavictimization in natural disasters is not natural and that the responsible Lesseuls are the agents of the State and their policies of interest.

Head Description: The government's adjustment policy punishes the people and favors the most reactionary right plans to return to the government.

The beginning of the classes is approaching and most boys cannot take off shoes, notebooks and useful, which cost barbarity.

The anger grows in the factories for the cost of living. The workers and workers of Mondelez say: "The salary is not enough." Inflation remains axes, retirements and social plans. In the AMBA, a kilo of bread comes out 480pesos. The energy and supportible rates also increased at the beginning of the month.

With the claim to put a 60% roof to the peers, the ruling the blank salaries, which leaves thousands of formal workers under the poverty line and in turn throws down the salaries in black.

It is unbearable to increase rents that according to the current law is of 85% for this month. Many families cannot pay it, they will look for homes in villas, or will remain in the streets. The earth, whether to live or work for fortunes.

The rural workers, the peasants and the farmers are in a stale situation aggravated by the drought. Those who dedicate themselves to cattle sold susvacas with the fallen price, and now the landowners earn again, when the kilo is sold with a 40% increase. Government measures favor landowners and hang the rural population.

The situation of the poorest has been aggravated. INDEC says there are 3,700,000 homeless argentinos. But to comply with the agreements imposed by the IMF, social plans are reached and food for popular dining rooms.

It is impossible to resolve this serious situation if it is not imposed from the streets measured in the sense of the “10 points” proposed by our party, so that the crisis is paid by those who continue to take it in the shovel, and it is broken with an infamous action with the IMF with the IMF , that of the Paris Club and other imperialist agreements.

****

** 2. ** ** The imperialist dispute and the struggle of the peoples ** grows **

Latin America and the world are shaken by disputes, wars and struggles.

Follow the rebellion of the Peruvian people. Conflicts to the south of the country show a area of much poverty despite the wealth that the mining companies take out day by day. More than 30 thousand workers are suspended. Enel Comercio, more than 100 thousand were left without work. There were companies destroyed by protesters. Police shops, Courts of Justice Yotros state buildings were also destroyed. The General Confederation of Workers, the largest lacentral in the country, called to join the indefinite general strike.

** Solidarity with the rebellion of the Peruvian people that is an example for all peoples of America and the world. Freedom to Pedro Castillo. We repudiate the state of state that displaced and imposed it to Dina Boluarte. **

We are a few days from February 24, when a year after the Russian imperialist invasion is completed. The Ukrainian government warned that it put a brutal offensive to its forces to take over Donbás for March. We repudiate the Russian imperialist invasion, and being supportive with the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people who fight to be the owner of Sudestino.

** We will promote in this anniversary pronouncements of the organizations of the Argentine Pueblo for the withdrawal of the invading troops and the rejection of the presentation of Yankee and NATO imperialism. **

The superpowers continue to prepare for war. The Secretary of Defense of Yankee Imperialism, Lloyd Austin, made a recent South Acorea trip to make agreements on the Sea of Japan and then was affilipins to make new military agreements that imply four new andquis new bases in that country, and warned of the possibility of a Conchina Guerra in 2025. Philippines maintains border conflicts with Chinese elimperialism precisely in the China Sea, and in its Losyanquis coast they intend to build a submarine base.

Meanwhile a Chinese spy balloon survived for days the Cielonorteamericano until it was finally shot down by the Yankees. As a result of Chinese imperialism maneuver, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, canceled a visit to that country. As we have been raising the dispute, the corners of the earth arrive and acts on each of our countries.

Yankee imperialism, in an agreement with the Government of Paraguay, passed the badly called Paraná-Paraguay hydrovy. After failing a Yankee intent of installing a military base in Tierra del Fuego, the Fueguino governor negotiates with China the installation of a port that would give it a strategic position in the meeting of the two oceans.The imperialist dispute stains the reality of the oppressed countries such as the Name and nail their claws, associated with one or another sector of the dominant classes of each of them.

** 3. ** ** The streets **

2022 ended with great popular mobilizations and 2023 starting the unit for protests that win the streets.

We fight so that the kids/is have their shoes and the supplies to powers. So that those who go hungry can eat.

There is a youth that seeks roads to star in their struggles and end up consusing sufferings as seen in the camps of the Mus, the strain and the FNC.

On 15/2, the National Peasant Federation performs a national day of the Hucha with activities by place, with the claims of the sector and for “that Laplat to resolve emergencies leaves those who have been raising in Papa”. They accompany the unemployed and precarious of the CCC and other forces as autonomous.

On 24/2, Mijp - CCC retirees are mobilized, because retirement, which charges the vast majority of retirees in our country, is because of the indigence line and with the miserable increases it continues to have for inflation.

Many unions fight to recover their salaries in the peers. They do not want "ceilings" or handles in which they get them again.

Women's movements continue to fight equal salary alike, against the violence they suffer and the lack of government measures. They will prepare for a great mobilization in the streets by March 8, internetational day of working women.

There are conditions to unite the popular forces in mass acts on the 24th demarzo, repudiating the 1976 genocidal coup d'etat, the judicialization of the struggles, and the criminal attacks against political and social leaders.

In many provinces that have unfolded the elections, the discussion advances to the formation of electoral fronts that contemplate the claims for popular emergencies and national sovereignty.

Together with the change and the powerful sectors of the ruling classes that are behind that reactionary right, in the middle of an internal fierce by candidacies, they continue to work to fulfill their goal of again Sergobierno.

Mauricio Macri, Patricia Bullrich and other candidates have their deliquidar plan, blood, fire and jail, the conquests of the andpopular labor movement, to carry out the adjustment and delivery of national sovereignty. ** That is why we continue to direct the main blow of the popular struggle to the sector that politically expresses macrismo. **

It was the fight and unity in the streets that stopped the reacting offensive to further prosecute the protests at the end of last year.

It was the role of social, trade union and popular organizations, which, who is forces in the streets, led the struggles against the Demacri government, which created conditions to defeat it at the polls with the front front.

In 2023 it will be key to that reactionary right. For that, there is no other way than to advance in the struggles with ** The prominence of the people in the streets. ** **

The Government did not comply, nor is it fulfilling, the commitments it took in the 2019 elections. The three sectors that direct the front and the government are involved in the dispute by the candidacies. In the economy, the three -sectors agree to prioritize the payment of a fraudulent debt with the IMF Yorganisms of the out of outside and from the inside of the country. Everyone's front does not have any open instance to social, union and political organizations that we integrate; forces that we want to discuss the Degobierno program.

** The government does not see the painful situation of much of the people, or listen to it that grows. Do not value the popular prominence in the streets, nor do it have a position of the new judicial offensive against those fighting in the streets. It is a policy that divides popular and emboldeneal forces to the right -wing. **

** 4. ** ** “To the Malvinas kids that I will never forget…” **

The popular forces continue to fight the unity in the struggle, with ** the protagonism of the people in the streets **, so that there is no ** or ** personacon hunger in our homeland. With ** all ** the kids and kids with their shoes and their school supplies. With ** increases ** in salaries, retirements and social plans according to the basic basket. With the ** elimination ** of the employment tax to the workers. With ** all ** families with land to live or to cultivate food in each town. With the declaration of ** National Emergency ** in violence against women.A little over a month ago, millions in Argentina took to the streets to celebrate the triumph of the World Cup and singing "Boys ...", which became everyone's hymn. There we paid tribute "to the Malvinas kids that I will never pile."

An example in that sense has just been given the recent seventh marchamultisectoral to Lake hidden, Río Negro, repudiating the imperialist agent Lewis, whose house gathered officials of justice, macro and Clarín characters. That reactionary right, on the contrary, defends this English agent and demonizes the native peoples, acting as "Gurkas", as those Nephale mercenaries who fought for silver for English imperialists when invaded Malvinas in 1982 in 1982

Governor Rionegrina Arabela Carreras and former WeretilneCkkdefunder governor to the pirate Lewis, protect the patota that attacked the protesters, and put together a front next to a sector of Peronism and with the UCR. While, with everyone's front, a front of Peronist sectors, ELPTP-PCR, the Evita Movement and other popular forces was formed.

** 5. ** ** We are the party of Otto Vargas **

As the beloved Comrade Otto Vargas, general secretary from the funding of our party, taught us until his death on February 14, 2019, the revolutionary communists fight for making possible what is necessary.

The PCR has just turned 55, with the same objective with which we founded 1968: ** the National and Social Liberation Revolution. **

We have come to make a successful 13 National Congress of our party, concuyas ** Resolutions ** and ** program ** We go to the meeting of the great debatepolytic in the masses around what is the exit in favor of the power.

We put the center to continue in front of all the struggles for popular emergencies, national sovereignty and the validity of our democratic conquests and liberties, and from there we offer a struggle in the PCR and the JCR, to advance in the path of national liberation and socially in Patria.

In this year, that many reduce a fight in the electoral field, we go with our proposal of ten measures to all workplaces, study and housing and in all the movements that we participate, to advance in the work and unite with all the popular sectors and nationals so that these conflute and impose from the streets that the crisis is paid by those who are carrying it in shovel and the infamous agreement is broken with the IMF and all the antinational corners with different imperialisms. Only in this way can we advance resolve emergencies and in the defense of our national sovereignty.

With the revolutionary example of our beloved Otto Vargas, at the end of February 14, four years of his death, ** we prompted from the central commitment that the whole game and its youth make a national day of painted and dissemination activities of the PCR In the Centers for Concentration Workers, Peasants, Original and Popular Entodo El País. **

In his farewell, comrade Jacinto Roldán said: “The story of Otto Vargasno has finished writing. Because a communist is not judged only because he has done throughout his militant life but for what he leaves. ”

Four years after his death we proudly say that the PCR continues its legacy: nonos we paralyzed, we did not sell and follow the struggle for the revolution and portrminate with the exploitation of man by man.

We continue to reaffirm what Otto said on the 40th anniversary of Our Party: “We are sure that our struggle will succeed. We believe what Mao said: the logic of the oppressed is to fight, fail, to fight, to fail again, and so on to triumph. And we, with the Lamisma conviction with which we found the Revolutionary Communist Party ... we say that there will be new triumphant revolutions, that imperialism will be divided, and that ultimately communism will triumph worldwide. ”

### LLL 2023: "Long live the International Communist League!"

![](Images/COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL/2023-02-07T99-00-00-04-00/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_header.png)This year again the LLL demonstration took place in Berlin in January. Whilethis annual event is primarily a showdown of the various forces of therevolutionist movement in the FRG, this year the Maoists had a differentmessage: the International Communist League - ICL was founded!A manifoldinternational contingent proclaimed this historic message at thedemonstration, fulfilling the demand that had been made in the previous yearsat the same demonstration - also in the struggle: For the new organization ofthe international proletariat!

![LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund1](Images/COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL/2023-02-07T99-00-00-04-00/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_1.png)This message was not only powerfully spread, but also joyfully accepted bymany masses. Several times masses asked for the flags of the ICL, which werecarried on the demonstration in four languages - Spanish, English, Turkish andGerman. Some even wanted to buy them on the spot. An excerpt of the ICL'sPolitical Declaration and Principles was distributed as a leaflet, andPartizan comrades handed out printed brochures with the Declaration in Englishand Turkish. Thus, the radiance that the LLL demonstration has in the FRG andparts of Western Europe was used to celebrate and spread this success of theMaoists.
