<p><strong>URGENT CALL FOR HELP!</strong></p>

<p>The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck in Pazarcık district of Maraş ataround 04:20 on Monday morning, February 6, was felt in Maraş, as well asMalatya, Mardin, Bingöl, Elazığ, Siirt, Sivas, Van, Muş, Bitlis, Hakkari,Adana, Osmaniye, Batman, Urfa, Kilis, Diyarbakır, Antep, Hatay, northern Syriaand Rojava provinces. The earthquake caused extensive damage and loss of life.According to the latest official statements, thousands of people lost theirlives in the Turkish Kurdistan region alone, while around 6,000 people wereinjured. In addition to the destruction of many houses, buildings andhospitals, airports and roads have also been severely damaged, and with theaddition of winter conditions, rescue efforts are becoming even moredifficult. In addition, as the aftershocks continue, new earthquakes areoccurring and there are still many people under the rubble. Rescue and reliefteams have not yet reached many areas, and the people continue rescue effortswith their own strength. Therefore, it is a reality that the number of peoplekilled and injured is much higher than the official figures.</p>
<p>However, the information provided in the media is only within the borders ofTurkey. Moreover, hundreds ofpeople have lost their lives and thousands ofothers have been wounded in northern Syria and the Rojava region…The fact thatit is a cross-border and war zone and the difficult weather conditions makethe problem in the area even bigger…<img alt="" src="../Images/ATIK/2023-02-07T98-00-00-04-00/WhatsApp-Image-2023-02-07-at-14.35.09.jpeg" /></p>
<p>As ATİK, Yeni Kadın and YDG; first of all, while conveying our get well wishesto our people, we express our condolences to the relatives of those who losttheir lives, we wish a speedy recovery to our injured people and we declarethat we are with them.</p>
<p>We know that; fascists who destroy nature with fixed rent policies that servetheir own interests by increasing exploitation. R.T. Erdogan, the currentrepresentative of the Turkish state, and his cohorts, the AKP + MHPgovernment,will again shed crocodile tears in the face of the catastrophe our people areexperiencing today andwill say that their pain is great.</p>
<p>Our people living in Kurdistan, which the Turkish fascism only thinks ofduring election periods, have been ignored for years with policies ofannihilation and denial, and their vital resources have been deliberatelydestroyed by war policies. Although Turkey is an earthquake zone, instead ofbuilding earthquake-resistant buildings, thosewho invite disasters with thezoning policies carried out under the name of „urban transformation" aiming atthe interests of those in power, with buildings built at gigantic heights, aretrying to dampen the reactions of the people by shedding crocodile tears afterthe disasters.</p>
<p>But in vain… They are no longer able to hide the fact that the magnitude ofthe victimization in natural disasters is not natural, and that the only onesresponsible are the state authorities and their interest policies.</p>
<p>Let's grow solidarity with the victims of the earthquake!</p>
<p>As the Confederation of Workers form Turkey in Europe (ATIK), New Women (YeniKadın), New Democratic Youth (Yeni Demokratik Gençlik), we have started adonation campaign to show solidarity with the victims of the earthquake bothin Turkish Kurdistan and in Rojava and to deliver the campaign directly to thepeople.</p>
<p>We call on all our people, local and migrant democratic forces, especially allour organizations operating in European geographies, to mobilize in the faceof this disaster, to join and strengthen the campaign. Let's bandage thewounds of our people affected by the earthquake together with the donationsyou send to the bank account number we have published below!</p>
