Prices of goods keep onhiking while their wages remain paltry. The average salary of a worker is noteven half of what must be the truly living wage. Even worse, the true value ofcurrent daily wages decrease because of the increase in inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-Marcos Jr. regime deliberately preserves this situation.This is favorable for the expansion of cheap labor that its ruling classes andcapitalist masters pine for. Because of the job crisis and lack of decentemployment, although wages are almost mere change, workers are compelled toyield to inhumane working conditions and wages rather than to lose theirsources of living completely.\n\nBut the Filipino workers have had enough. In Bikol and other parts of thecountry, the workers’ struggle and refusal to tolerate and accept these slave-like conditions are fast spreading and gaining momentum. They are perseveringin advocating their democratic interests in various ways and means. They areorganizing their ranks and forge unions and organizations that will championtheir demands and clamor.\n\nThe widening unity and intensifying struggle of workers for their rights alsoheighten the political consciousness of the whole nation and fuels their willto fight. NDF-Bikol appeals to Bikolano workers to join and take part in theworkers movement and combine their strength with the people’s united force. Intheir struggle for their interests, they can always be assured that therevolutionary movement is always on their side. As the true Party andorganization of all oppressed and exploited, they can be certain that the CPP-NPA-NDF throughout the whole country is with their every step forward.', 'categories': ['Workers'], 'source': 'https://philippinerevolution.nu/statements/true-value-of-wages-is-on-a-downward-track/'}
