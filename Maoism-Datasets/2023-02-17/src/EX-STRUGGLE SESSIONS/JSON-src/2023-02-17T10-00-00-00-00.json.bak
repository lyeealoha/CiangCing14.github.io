This was justa week before the events beginning on IWWD in which the cult was abolished.Luke has also written a foreword to his criticism to shed more light on hisexperience with the cult. Personally reading this criticism was incrediblytransformative to me at an important time, to recognize that I was supportingthe production of misogynistic and transphobic ideas that was connected to amisogynistic and transphobic practice-Rita\n\n## Foreword\n\nThe folks running this website have asked to publish a criticism I made ofStruggle Sessions in February 2022. I want to first provide some context, someof my newer thoughts, and who I am. The last name I used in politicalorganizing was Luke. I was involved in the Austin-based cult from 2016 untilInternational Working Women\'s Day 2022, when the cult was destroyed. I was inclose proximity to the majority of the handful who are attempting to revivethe cult up until I was forced to move in summer 2020, to conduct work inother cities. I have a petty bourgeois background which was well known by thecult leaders. Before joining the cult, I was a liberal activist. I no longerconsider myself a Maoist. I say these things because I want to bestraightforward and honest and not pretend to be someone I am not. It\'sincorrect for me to falsify my beliefs in order for me to gain the support ofmy intended audience. That\'s what the cult would have asked me to do; I liedfor them every day, for all sorts of reasons. I am sick and tired of lying. Ihave had problems trying to relate and express myself to people who doconsider themselves Maoists, and I understand that\'s probably primarilybecause they don\'t like to see me "turn my back" on a cause they believe isgood. However, I do not believe the cult actually gave me a proper educationof Maoism. I believe they misused politics for their own gain; that beingnotoriety, respect, and recognition from revolutionary organizations andthinkers across the world, as well as a base of supporters that would doanything to keep them housed, fed, and safe. Jared did not imagine that hisinitial project of RGA, or what it turned into, might gain its own legs andcontinue on with new and better leadership; whenever he was replaced it wasonly out of necessity and his replacements were treated as a seatwarmer. Fewpeople were brought up ideologically to serve as these seatwarmers and therest of us were powerless to replace them until we took the final step ofrefusing to participate in Jared\'s project anymore. Therefore, I do not feelcapable of making an argument against the cult within the framework of Maoism,beyond the simple principle that it is wrong to mistreat and abuse the people.This is the only belief necessary to understand the "CR-CPUSA" as adestructive force, opposed to any sort of progressive aims.\n\nI have to be frank and tell you all that I have not revisited any StruggleSessions articles, or really much theory at all. I have primarily been focusedon understanding why the leaders treated us the ways they did, and why I didnot fight back sooner. I started this learning journey with my understandingthe cult leaders to be revisionists because they did not uphold the mass line.They despised the people, they did not trust their membership, and theyconsidered their own ideas to be the most ideologically pure without takingthe ideas of the people into consideration. Although cult experts generally donot "speak the same language" as those who uphold communism, I found that theywere saying the same thing about cult leaders - cult leaders are narcissistswho cannot tolerate any challenge to their superiority and entitlement.\n\nBecause my focus has not been on relearning theory I cannot speak to how muchI still support the content of my criticism. However, I do still stand by myassertion that Struggle Sessions rarely, if ever, tried answer the questionsthat were the most pertinent in the minds of people who want to see progressin the world. It took me a long time to notice this, partially because I wasmade to believe some of these issues were much bigger than they were, andpartially because I did not want to make waves. I only made this criticism afew weeks before the cult fell apart, after I had been under significantlyless control for over a year. When I read it now, I am shocked to remember howexcited I was to write this and to anticipate a response. If I had tried tomake these criticisms while I still lived in Austin, I would have been soafraid to hear the response. I would expect verbal mistreatment for it. Yet,because of the security culture and dogmatism, this was the sharpestexpression of anger I could take on without being removed entirely. As areader of Struggle Sessions, I could express rage at their failure to takewomens\' struggles seriously. Addressing the actual facts about how theymistreated women could only happen in my clandestine reports as a pre-partymember and militant, and my language in those had to be rid of anger,disappointment, and urgency in order to even be heard.\n\nI say all this because I want it to be noted down in plain language, in onespot, that the working methods and actions of the former organizations underthe CR-CPUSA umbrella were incompatible with their stated goals of developingcadre, encouraging two line struggle, and cultivating the best and mostcapable leaders for a revolutionary project. Jared set out to become anideologue from day one. There is no shame in having great aspirations butthere is all the shame and all the blame in putting blinders on and steppingon your comrades to achieve your own individual aspirations. Jared is one ofthe most shameful things to be. A petty tyrant, ignorant, cowardly, andincapable of introspection or offering sincere apology and self criticism."Narcissist" is too good for him, as even some narcissists are capable ofunderstanding they lack empathy and aim to understand how their actions harmothers.\n\nI have no more forgiveness for those who have both personally interacted withJared and also know what transpired under his leadership and still uphold hisjoke of a "committee" consisting of his fellow petty tyrants and those veryfew who have chosen loyalty instead of justice. I have no more forgiveness forthe International Communist League that chose to invite his delegate to theirconference after everything was revealed and merely temporarily deny themmembership in the league. Those who gave a damn about what happened havealready shown their support for the former members and have reminded me that Iam entitled to my rage. I have realized that I was foolish to think that Icould ever make these people understand how they hurt us - by the time theorganization had to cannibalize itself to end the mistreatment, anypossibility for rectification had disappeared.\n\nOver the years, I have lost track of how many times, and in how many ways, Iripped my heart out of my chest, and timidly turned it over to Jared or Chrisor others for their consideration. Almost every time, it was met with silence,"it\'s not a good time for this," or "you\'re wrong." I am done. Anyone whoclaims to want to understand has had their opportunity. I encourage any otherformer member that is still trying to be heard to believe others when theytell you who they are the first time. The ICL chose a lunatic over the dozensJared personally mistreated and the hundreds he manipulated into believing inhim.\n\nI have been telling my story this entire past year. There are perhaps othersyet to speak up, there are stories that are only half written or whispered,and there are other former members you will never hear from. I understand themotivations behind all these now. I\'ve realized it would be a waste of time tokeep being vulnerable in front of people who have absolutely no interest inhearing me out. The situation is far simpler than Jared\'s allies would like tobelieve. Jared and Chris knew that my ex tried to rape me, and they did notspeak to me about him. They allowed him to continue his leadership roles in acity where he had no supervision and he raped the people he was leadinginstead of me. They knew he had a problem mistreating those he had power overbefore all this happened, and they did not seek out professional care for hisvictims and actually were cold and cruel to them afterwards. This is oneincident in a six year period, and very in line with their typical workingmethod. To this day, the only apology or self criticism I received was an "I\'msorry" from Chris, and a "we can\'t get too involved in relationships" fromJared, who later forced me out of Texas due to a consensual and healthyrelationship he did not approve of. I asked them to look into this situationseveral more times, including right before the organization was wrecked. Jaredtook this request and the many others paired with Chris being replaced as hisseatwarmer leader, and threw them back in our faces, saying he wouldn\'t allowit. These are the facts. I do not need to elaborate on how damaging this wasto me and significantly more so to the actual victims. Those who have a heartalready understand.\n\nI wrote the criticism below as a last ditch effort to get the leadership tohear me. In 2021 I had several interactions with Liam, the last leading memberof Struggle Sessions, that made me see him as yet another problem element inthe leadership promoting misogyny. I could not detail those incidents in thiscriticism due to our security culture. I do not believe he ever read this, ashe had effectively abandoned his post months beforehand.\n\nIn the very last thing I wrote before waking up from the cult\'s influence, Iwas trying to explain why I found it so essential to combat the internalissues immediately, even at the expense of any and all other work. I said, "Domembers have an understanding of how shame works? Like would they come to [themass organizations] about the most severe aspects of their backwards thinking?Do they think [the mass organizations] could solve it? Do they think [the massorganizations are] responsible for helping them solve it?" I am proud ofmyself for trying to argue for this, but I can see now how hopeless of a causeit was.\n\nAt the time, I thought I was telling the leaders to take the log out of theireyes before trying to take the splinters out of the eyes of others. I wantedthem to make a realistic assessment of themselves and the people they wereattracting to the cult. In reality, the leaders\' eyes had been gouged out longago by their wrongdoings. They are walking around the world totally blind toreality. They are insisting they can see perfectly and that if the rest of us"knew what was good for us" we would allow them to perform ocular surgery onus. If they think my assessment is unfair, I dare them to come out of theshadows, out of the no-visibility gutters they are doing graffiti in like thecowards they are, to tell the world why their abuse was correct.\n\nLastly, I wish everyone who left the cult, or has been watching us from thesidelines, the best of luck in whatever it is you are all doing now. I havefaith that we will all be more and more able to recognize and combat undueinfluence as time passes and we seek to understand ourselves and the cultbetter. I have faith that the further away we get from the cult\'s influence,the closer we will be to the majority of people of the world.\n\n* * *\n\n## Email: A Criticism\n\nAre you aware that the prevailing assumption among many readers is that thejournal is dead? I don\'t believe it is, but I don\'t understand why so muchtime has passed since the call for submissions and criticisms has passed, yetnothing but poems have been released. I do not think it would take so muchtime to explain what the problem is briefly so that we can offer help anddeeper criticism.\n\nMy criticisms are a long time coming, and maybe I should have sent them closerto the initial call, but later is better than never, and I think I have abetter grasp on my criticisms now anyways.\n\nBrowsing through the website is disheartening, now that I have a better graspon my criticisms. The recent content on Chairman Gonzalo, mostly reprints, isgood. The restâ€¦ Jacobin? Sakai? Peterson? Do you think the masses payattention to them? Even when they do, do you think they really give them somuch weight as to merit a response? Are you writing this for them or becauseyou want to see a Settlers fan squirm? I once had a manager that wasinterested in Peterson, and he was much more interested in what I had to sayabout the origin of the family than anything Peterson said. He treatedPeterson like food for thought, he treated what I said about women\'soppression like I had just answered a million and one questions for him. Andthis was just from a simple conversation when he wondered out loud why menwere still treating me poorly in our industry. He didn\'t need to be toldPeterson was wrong about Marxism. HE JUST NEEDED MARXISM.\n\nI do not assert that the above mentioned articles contain incorrect lines, nordo I think they are totally useless. I have learned things from them. But Iwonder why these were given attention and not other subjects - nothing that Icould present to my family members as something they would be interested inand understand without significant background study. And they are even pettybourgeois liberals - yet there is Struggle Sessions content, few and farbetween as they may be, that I can and have referenced in politicalconversation with them, and have them actually engage with and come to supportthese lines more. So I know you are capable of making content that is relevantto the masses. Somewhere the focus shifted.\n\nThe two articles I reference most are "Race, Class, and Stratification" and"Political Economy and Prostitution." They have answered more questions foractivists and masses I\'ve known than any other of your articles. They aredifficult reads, but not impossible when studied together. They also refuteprevailing postmodernist lines that the activists hold onto, without seemingas if these activists are the only audience. They directly attack thesuperstructure. This should be the target of your criticisms, the bourgeoisieas a whole and its superstructure. Not academics that the vast majority ofpeople could not put a face to on any given day.\n\n"Bourgeois Culture is a Cadaver" was pretty good too, I appreciate that theanalysis is on popular culture, not academic culture. But then you followed itup with "Letter to the Editor: Class Struggle or Sexual Liberation?" To beclear - I generally support what was said in this. However, I don\'t believeyou were really ready to defend your lines. I think you explained them poorlyand although you came to correct points you have crucial misunderstandingsunderlying them and the critics sniffed them out fast. And I think the root ofthese misunderstandings is an underdeveloped understanding of the women\'squestion. Most telling to me is that in "Consumer Options" you chose to focuson polyamory, not monogamy. And I was duped by this at first, because I hadheavy postmodernists influences in my past, which have continued to blind meto whether what I am concerned about is what most people are also concernedabout, or if it is a remnant of me focusing on issues that postmodernistsfavor. Polyamory is not the pressing issue for women - it is rather monogamy,and many, if not most, polyamorists do not necessarily see it as a "better"option, but merely an option, a preference. This bad idea should be attacked,but most importantly, monogamy and the family structure should be attacked.You did not do this, you let Engels do it for you in one paragraph.\n\nDo you not see this as the more pressing matter or are you just unaware of howyou can build upon the criticisms of monogamy that have already been made? Ican think of several ways; with porn more popular than ever, women not onlyhave to accept that their husbands will likely cheat on them, they now have toaccept that the cheating will happen in their bed, in front of them, at theexpense of trafficked women, and that as his wife she may be coerced intoparticipating. Women are now, on the whole, workers but not a single thing hashappened to relieve them of child care. Women are being abused, raped, andkilled by their monogamous partners at the same rate they always have been,but now because there are meager resources for her, and the vast majority ofpeople agree she should not have to endure that and is allowed to leave, nowshe gets blamed for staying when she feels trapped! And you have skated overthese issues that are pressing NOW and merely said our relationships will bebetter under socialism.\n\nIn regards to polyamory, hookup culture, etc, and what you DID say in thearticle - you still treated the issue as if men and women are on the sameplaying field here. Maybe talk to a few (more) women, just a suggestion! WomenKNOW they are getting the lesser hand in this setup, you still don\'t talkabout that! You don\'t talk about how many women WANT monogamy but feel likethey have to have casual sex in order to keep partners interested! You don\'ttalk about the women who have agreed under coercion to open relationships,where her potential extra partners (if any) are limited to specific people orother women, and he is free to do what he wants with anyone - just a morebald-faced version of the old monogamy! You don\'t mention that promiscuity isdespised in women, but celebrated in men, even while men are harassing everysingle woman to put out!\n\nWhat was the point of this article if you aren\'t going to mention any of this?I think it might cause some internal, purely personal, reflection; it does notcall for women to refuse and attack chauvinism and it does not call for men toexamine their chauvinism. A missed opportunity, AT BEST. If the article hadbeen written as I suggest, I doubt there would have been so many peoplerejecting it. They know their relationship has problems. There was no solutionfor them in this article. "Monogamy and polyamory are bourgeois, in socialismwe will have it better." As if the root of many intimate problems is somethingother than misogyny, as if it is something we are unable to attack today.\n\nHow could anyone write about sexuality and not give consideration to theparticular ways it affects women? I have no answer besides that it ischauvinism. When I was even a liberal I had higher expectations for analysison this issue than what the article provided.\n\nOnto "Bourgeois Culture." I like this article. The one point of contentionthat many readers had was putting "non-binary" in quotes. On the first read, Iskimmed over this. Now it reads like a dog whistle. "We think this is anti-materialist, but we will wait for someone to be outraged before we botherexplaining!" Was the point to name the inclusion of this identity as a meredistraction, or was the point to say it is a false idea that needs to beattacked? Choose one or both and make your point! But this is really minorcompared to the response - I can understand not wanting to give weight to thisidentity by just listing it with other groups of people, but at the same timenot wanting to distract from the article with explaining why this was done.\n\nAs for the response. I think it is good up until this point, where manyreaders found their first point of attack:\n\n"The facts of biological reproduction and the oppression of women rooted inprivate property divide society into men and women. While biologicalreproduction is the basis, which is reflected for instance in the struggleover reproductive rights, humans are primarily social animals and so socialrelationships conditioned by class society are primarily determinate on sexand sexuality. Hence homosexuality and transition to the social role of theopposite sex has an objective existence that is conditioned by the historicaldevelopment of society."\n\nThis is a good understanding - expect that it does not provide an explanationas to when, and why, there have occasionally been third sex categories, thatare not explained well by transgenderism in at least a few cases. Those whosupport a nonbinary identity have not grasped that self categorization is notwhat created these minor, external roles. This would be simple to haveexplained. I\'m not sure if you did not investigate this, or considered theseexceptions minor enough to not mention. The latter would tell me that you havealso not investigated the ways in which proponents of the nonbinary-as-material-reality line attempt to support their claims.\n\n"It argues that one can escape the contradiction between men and women at anindividual level through personal feeling and superficial changes inpresentation."\n\nMany of your supporters reject that identity can cause someone to escape thiscontradiction, and they have been trying to formulate a line that includesthis for several months. Even in circles where identity is the end-all, be-all, they will still refer to those facing women\'s oppression as "femme-presenting," "affected by misogyny," etc. They are avoiding being scientific,but even they cannot deny when oppression happens, and this statement failsthem too, to an extent.\n\nYou continue to focus on identity and superficial changes while not addressinghow this is different from trans people. Are you aware that many peopleidentifying as nonbinary claim to experience physical dysphoria, and some ofthem pursue medical transition? How does merely attacking the identity resolvetheir personal crisis, if you don\'t go into explaining what creates dysphoria,what it is exactly that makes someone trans, and by what means, in whatmoment, does someone change from man to woman, or vice versa? I do not know ifyou are presently capable of grasping this either, and I wonder if that is whyyou did not get into it, because how can we understand trans people besides inrelation to men, women, and the oppression of women? And as I have said above,I don\'t think you have done all you can to grasp the women\'s question.\n\nI have told a few people, those who are trying to write an opposing line ongender, that they shouldn\'t bother until they can prove they have fullygrasped the women\'s question. And I would say the same to you. I would lovenothing more than to have others unite with me on what exactly makes me trans.But please do not bother. You should have never attempted to begin with, youshouldn\'t until you understand women. We all agree I am not the importantdemographic here. I really feel that you gave in to a very loud minority.\n\n"LGBT people are not a distinct social force and do not have a decisive rolein politics as such. Imperialism does not depend on the discrimination of LGBTpeople, and today â€˜pink-washesâ€™ itself by giving LGBT people a large degree oflegal equality in order to create a false image of progressivismâ€”theproductive forces are developed enough in the imperialist countries thatcapitalism has lost its pressing need to reproduce the oppressed class as notevery family needs to produce children to maintain a socially-necessaryproletarian population."\n\nI believe I agree with this, but it does not give answers to the people whoare wondering why there is an attack on trans people, specifically children,right now. My understanding are that these attacks are for the sake of thesuperstructure, not for the sake of maintaining the family unit, but I havenot developed my thoughts beyond this. Stating that LGBT people have morerights now does not satisfy the need to understand the attacks that happenregardless, regardless of our new rights and regardless of the fact that weare not a distinct social force.\n\n"We reiterate the message of the essay Consumer Options that monogamy andpolyamory both are bourgeois and backwards; similarly bothheterosexualityâ€”understood as the superstructural support reproducing theeconomic unit of the familyâ€”and â€˜queernessâ€™ are old bourgeois forms thatoppose the new, socialist social relations."\n\nThis is still not useful. You have not allowed yourself to imagine a newworld. You have not given a way for readers to begin to understand theirrelationships in a more progressive way. And you have not demonstrated thatyou understand how any of these things affect women specifically.\n\nI want to point out a few things in the 2021 New Years Statement lastly. Ihave mainly looked to criticize the past year of articles, and present the twomain points: that you do not understand what the masses are clamoring to hear,and you do not understand the oppression of women. In the New Years Statementyou say:\n\n"We take up our post against all sorts of incorrect ideas generated within thecontext of the class struggle which serve the ruling class and which harm theproletariat in its struggle,"\n\nIs this what you have done? Do you have your ear among the people or do youhave it among the liberal protest movement, or maybe even among the dwaddlerson reddit and twitter? Did I miss some moment where the masses were gatheringaround the dinner table to talk about Jordan Peterson\'s all-meat diet or DemiLovato coming out as nonbinary? Are these really the most dangerous andenticing ideas being offered to the masses in order to quell them?\n\nThe majority of goals for physical copies, paywalled articles, etc outlined inthe last section of the New Year statement have not been met. You changededitors and immediately switched over to being concerned with the form, notthe political lines, not the usefulness, not the ability to defend your lines.And so you could not do all that you wanted. You\'re treating it like a blog.If you have not yet, I suggest you make copies of the "greatest hits" and themost criticized articles and survey the masses on what they find useful oreven have the barest of interest in based on your description of them. I admitI have not tried this but I certainly do pick and choose carefully what Isuggest others read after I have studied one of your pieces with them.\n\nWhile developing this criticism I have come up with some rough ideas forpieces that I think the masses I have interacted with would like to read, I amhappy to share them; if there is good chance these problems can be turnedaround I want to be more active in contributing as a supporter of the journal.I think it both myself and you (Struggle Sessions itself) can be criticizedfor the fact that I have not felt like it was my duty or place to bring myideas forward. Writing this has made me optimistic that change is possible,once the problem is understood. I hope you are all feeling the same and thatthe criticisms you have already gotten have proven useful.\n\nLuke, reader and activist\n\nAdvertisement', 'source': 'https://struggle-sessions.com/2023/02/17/voices-a-militant/'}
