 presented publicly by the CISL on January 24th they say in a manner 
 explicit as much as the masters made profits and the workers lost the 
 their salary in all these years. </p>
<p>Cisl contributed to this lowering of wages in a thousand ways helping 
 The masters with agreements, contracts etc. etc. and the "dashboard"(su cui torneremo)which they presented is precisely full of this position; A phrase above all 
 For now- "productivity, <strong> historical disease of the Italian economy </strong>, is 
 grown by 15 percentage points in a decade ". </p>
<p>This is precisely the voice of the master who complains of this "disease 
 historical ", while the CISL brings the figure to say that despite the crisis, the 
 productivity has increased, that is, the workers have worked more and more 
 intensely!</p>
<p>This is not a novelty since "<strong> The capitalist constantly tries to 
 Reduce wages to their minimum physical limit </strong> and to extend the day of 
 I work on its physical limit Massimo ... "As Marx says in <em>salario, price and 
 profit</em> where it adds, to strengthen, that "<strong> the general trend of the 
 capitalist production is not to raise the average normal wages, but of 
 reduce it </strong>. " </p>
<p>This is why a daily battle is needed on salary, and beyond, 
 Still Marx- "If the working class yielded by cowardice in his conflict 
 daily with capital, it would be deprived of the ability to 
 undertake any greater movement. " </p>
<p>To this battle we must support that of theoretical formation!</p>

<p>There was a lot of noise when Luiz Inacio dismissed, on the 21st, about 80 military 
 that served in the Planalto and the then army commander, Júlio César 
 of Arruda, replacing it with Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva. Some stunned 
 before the blind belief in the "stability" of bourgeois democracy and its 
 eating institutions in the country and that Yankee imperialism "will not allow 
 A coup d'etat "came to proclaim that the cash" Government of Lula " 
 It had been inaugurated there, without protection of the Armed Forces. Luiz Inacio 
 proclaimed that he distrusted the armed forces, that he wanted an office of 
 Institutional Security(GSI)No military equipment and played with the public to 
 that he would not accept military orders assistants(y poco después, tenerlos), 
 In a staging that he would not undergo "military power", to treat 
 to restrict the maneuvering margin of the generals through isolation 
 of public opinion. </p>
<p>On the 31st, "surprising" a total of zero people with conscience 
 Politics, Luiz Inacio appointed 122 soldiers for the GSI. Mathematics is 
 Clara- instead of restricting the presence of militias and, therefore, their 
 Influence in the Government, the President of the Republic increased them!
 Immediately, the press reported that the PT gave the army endorsement to 
 prevent the Federal District PM will act, the night of January 8, 
 Against the camp, in the Army Headquarters. The episode, which 
 involved maneuvers with armed force tanks to deter PM, it was 
 Approved by Luiz Inacio, given the pressure of the generals. As is known, this 
 maneuver was carried out so that active and reserve officers and their families 
 They could leave the camp and not be arrested. </p>
<p>Now what does that reveal? That the staging of a strengthened Luiz Inacio, 
 What happens and passes with the military, lasted less than a soap pomp, since 
 The supposed force attributed to the government is a chimera, an illusion. The 
 opportunistic and liberals do not exaggerate that the defense of this democracy 
 corrupt and permissive bourgeois with all kinds of violence against the people do not 
 It moves them, on the contrary, it causes disgust and, above all, 
 distrust and anger. They pretend not to know, but they know very well that in politics the 
 Effective force are the masses, and not the notes of entities and charges, harmless 
 When they have no material support. But they want to believe this and try to deceive 
 The masses also create this fantasy. </p>
<p>While the government tries to restrict the coup movement with agreements of 
 Cabinet and grandiloquent pronouncements on "democracy" -which, 
 unknown to the wide masses in their daily lives-, it only becomes 
 inept, while true force is increasingly in 
 General( hoy, las tropas y, ahora, están jugando a ganar a las masas,
principalmente a la pequeña y mediana burguesía y apoyándose en los
evangélicos bolsonaristas entre los pobres). The government tends to 
 capitulation; After all, how could it not be otherwise, if from 
 The 2018 elections are silent in front of the constants 
 Military coup pronouncements? Not a single criticism, only 
 appeasement!After all, what can the coalition government do 
 reactionary, where the great bourgeoisie and landowners exercise power 
 servants of imperialism? If I had a minimum of decency, immediately 
 I would have called the masses to the streets in defense of freedoms

<p>Meanwhile, indigenous people are killed, as in the horrendous and criminal case 
 against the Yanomami, and the peasants are systematically killed in their 
 fair struggle for earth. On the morning of January 28, Bope Police, from 
 The Rondônia Military Police shot at peasants who climbed into a 
 boat to cross a river; The military arrested two young people, the 
 They dragged a separated place, they were tortured, they even started the 
 Language to one of them, and then executed them in cold blood. The monopolies of 
 the press, the illustrious political and the institutions of justice, heroes of 
 The defense of this democracy, silent completely. This has nothing to do 
 With his democracy, right? </p>
<p>It must also be said that the change of generals under the army, 
 Made by Luiz Inacio, nothing changes in the nature of force and neither 
 He even changes his coup intentions, which are unanimity among the high
Situation culminates the military coup. Just see that the now praised like 
 "Legalist commander", Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, was the same considered 
 protagonist in the writing of the intimidating tweet of Villas-Bôas, against the 
 HC of Luiz Inacio, in 2018 - a tweet that, by the way, was written by the ACFA 
 to intervene in national political life. This is the "legalistic general", 
 maximum guarantee of democracy in Brazil for the monopoly of the press and the 
 opportunism. What a bad sheets cover them!</p>
<p>The ACFA is calculating and reformulating its intervention plans every day 
 military, looking for the right time to intervene, promoting small 
 destabilizations using "green chickens" as cannon meat and, 
 Soon, signing new agreements with the government in which it comes out 
 reinforced on paper. of moderating power; Meanwhile, seek to win the 
 support from his master in the north and the support of public opinion to try 
 Crush the lifting of the town at the time they lift themselves with their 
 fair anger. </p>
<p>To stop the coup running it is impossible to have the aristocracy 
 opportunistic, drunk for decades of cocktails in palaces of the old state and 
 expectations of reigning for many more. The minimum is to rely on 
 the masses, mobilizing them for their minimum trampled rights day by day, to 
 through strikes, land shots, occupation of universities and schools, in 
 a torrent of revolutionary protests and struggles; Without a drop of illusion with 
 The democracy of the rich. </p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/Stalin-17.-partikongress-1.jpg" /><em> * </em> </p>
<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Our comrades in communist international(ci-ic.org)has published one 
 Article on the historical victory the Red Army won over Hitler fascism in 
 1943. Stalingrad was a turning point not only in the war but in humanity's 
 history.</strong> </p>
<p>The comrades write that the International Communist Association has taken chairman 
 Mao's position- comrade Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, who defined 
 Leninism and played a crucial role in World War II, especially on the basis 
 of the 7th congress in the Communist International. The comrades look 
 The article in connection with this position. </p>
<p>They write that chairman Mao has defined the battle of Stalingrad as not only 
 the turning point of the war between the Soviet Union and Germany, or in it 
 Anti -fascist world war, but a turning point in human history. </p>
<p>The Soviet Union, under the great leadership of comrade Stalin, led a 
 fair war, a large -scale and heroic defense, which used the burnt 
 Earth's tactics and won over the Hitler fascism at a price of 25 million 
 Soviet life. This great war was also important to inspire and generate 
 fair liberation wars in the colonies throughout the Third World. </p>
<p>German Wehrmacht attacked Stalingrad to take over the city on August 23, 1942. An aspect 
 By the importance of the city, it was the name of Stalin. In an order from mate 
 Stalin he demanded greater efforts and sacrifice from the Red Army. In this 
 The order says comrade Stalin among other things- </p>
<p>«Each commander, soldier in the Red Army and Political Commissioner must understand that 
 Our means are not unlimited. The territory of the Soviet State is not a desert, 
 But people - workers, farmers, intelligence, our fathers, mothers, wives, 
 Brothers, children. The territory of the Soviet Union that the enemy has conquered or 
 Want to conquer are bread and other products for the army, metal and fuel for 
 industry, factories, works that supply the army with weapons and ammunition, 
 Railways.(…)Further retreat means to waste ourselves away and at the same time 
 Sacrifice our motherland.(…)If we do not stop the retreat we will be without bread, 
 without fuel, without metal, without raw materials, without factories and works, without 
 Railways. This leads to a conclusion, it is time to stop the retreat. 
 Not one step back!"(Vår egen oversettelse.)Comrade Stalin declared that retreat was to be considered a betrayal. The population in 
 Stalingrad was incorporated into the armed resistance to Wehrmacht. The fascist 
 6. Army took the city but through Operation Uranus under the leadership of Georgij 
 Zjukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky, were organized troops north and west of 
 city. The Red Army surrounded Stalingrad, which caught nearly 300,000 
 enemy forces there and cut their supply lines, and then tighten the grip 
 more and more. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the battle of Stalingrad shows that in war is that 
 People, not weapons, which are the most important. The battle not only evolved from 
 street to street and house to house but from room to room and it was written heroic 
 Chapters in human history that shook the world. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the fascist offensive against the Soviet Union led by 
 the Nazis and with the support of fascists from Italy, Spain, Romania, Hungary 
 and the Bandera rats from Ukraine, threw millions of forces, Wehrmacht's best, 
 75 percent of their Air Force, into the invasion, but that Stalin and the Soviet Union 
 Was prepared and succeeded in resisting. One of the reasons was the wonderful 
 The intelligence service, the comrades write. Another Joseph Stalin's handling 
 of diplomacy. Furthermore, the Soviet Union used strategic defense along with it 
 Burnt earth's tactics and partisans behind enemy lines. They blasted Soviet 
 dams and dismantled factories so that the enemy should not get anything like 
 preferably. The German Nazis could not imagine that the socialist 
 The mother country would take such measures to combat them. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the dictatorship of the proletariat stood at stake, the revolution stood 
 at stake, and that one could not stop to think or allow himself to stay 
 hindered in some way. They write about heroic partisans, who were left behind 
 behind enemy lines alone with rifle, ammunition and vodka, to wait for 
 the enemy, and that the German Nazis lost an average of ten men to each such 
 Partisan when they were liquidating them. </p>
<p>The comrades write that one cannot forget Stalin's leadership, when considering 
 him, and how he always held on to the importance of the morale of the war, 
 how the conquered tabs and chin crosses from the Nazis were thrown on the ground 
 in front of Lenin's Mausoleum. The major military victories were also made to moral 
 wins. They write that the Brazilian comrades have stated that the victory against 
 Fascism in World War II is one of the major events in the process of it 
 Proletarian world revolution. Three important imperialist powers, Germany, 
 Japan and Italy, were defeated. This must be considered, highlighted and celebrated.
Antifascist war shows the enormous life force of the socialist system, that 
 imperialism is the source of all wars in modern times, that the people will prevail and 
 that imperialism is a paper tiger and that to defeat imperialist 
 Aggressors must be united people's revolutionary forces in all countries and form it 
 widest possible international front to gather the strokes against the main enemy of 
 the world's people. </p>
<p>The comrades end like this- "With the honorable red army rifles, Nazi became 
 Germany crushed, socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat rose in East- 
 Germany. That the red tab of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union waved over 
 The dark and broken German rich stag is undeniably a great moment for 
 the international proletariat that symbolizes the entire heroic and honorable 
 epic struggle against fascism in defense of the Soviet Union and for the development 
 of the proletarian world revolution. The statement from comrade dimitrov when he 
 set course for the Soviet Union after the big victory at the Nazi tribunal in 
 Leipzig was thus fulfilled- "We will create Soviet Germany!" " </p>

 crammed into a boat started by Sfax and headed to Lampedusa, including a 
 newborn, killed by the racist imperialist rhetoric of the "Fight against flows 
 irregular "of this government which, in reality, masks the criminal, racist, 
 policy of rejections in continuity with previous governments. </p>
<p><strong> The policy of the "2 weights and 2 measures" of this government </strong>- the Council of 
 Ministers has allocated 55 million euros for the realization of the interventions 
 in relation to the need to ensure rescue and assistance to the population 
 Ukrainian on the national territory Metre, at the same time, has been renewed 
 For another three years the Memorandum of Intesa between Italy and the government of 
 Libyan National Agreement. Meloni signed a 
 pact that plans to continue and strengthen the rejections into the sea of 
 People who flee from Libyan concentration camps. </p>

 these years destined just over 124 million euros for the supply of 
 naval and terrestrial means, of engines, of satellite instrumentation, courses 
 of training, as well as for the remittance of boats and the 
 supply of housing modules for the creation of an integrated system of 
 control of maritime and terrestrial borders in Libya. </p>
<p>It is a downward estimate made by the shopping observatory 
 Outdoor in migration of Italy, The Big Wall, of Actionid. Expenditure 
 difficult to monitor, both for complexity in the management methods,

 Precarious. </strong> </p>
<p>The struggle of the workers in contract for Beretta looks at all workers and

 factory, to unity with the other realities that fight, in participation in 
 <strong> 'National Assembly of February 18th in Rome </strong> <strong>. </strong> </p>

The workers on strike have 
 denounced '<strong> ba </strong> <strong> stands we can't take it anymore to run all day, to 
 cold, </strong> <strong> so we only break our back </strong> 'just as the 
 New Inail data on the strong increase in accidents and diseases

<p><strong> and against factory repression, made of discriminatory behavior, 
 arrogant, anti -union, _ like the 50 euros given in December as gratify 
 Only to the workers who have not striked, _ or leverage the double load 
 that the workers and mothers of the factory have in the assistance to the children by example, 
 with a real retaliation made of changes on duty and times, 
 sudden and personalized, to put uncomfortable workers in difficulty, 
 force them to make fatal jumps with babysitters. And of course of the 
 failed attempts to hinder the strike, which resolved, in front of the firmness 
 of the workers, in a frustrated </strong> </p>
<p><strong> Post(cancellato all'arrivo delle risposte)- 'They were 10 escaped home'. NO 
 I just don't think they ran away from the house, they have full brown to work 
 in those conditions. </strong> </p>
<p>The strike showed the new contract with MPM of 31.5.22(denunciato anche con un esposto)made in a hurry for the open investigation 
 -oprile 22- from the Guardia di Finanza 'against illegal use by 
 Beretta delle Cooperatives to always have manpower available 
 available and underpaid, explicitly defined as a transhumance of 
 workers', as a facade and commercial operation; How to download on 
 all responsibilities cooperatives; as if to cancel the fact that, i 
 results of the exploitation of precarious work and underpaid of the contract, 
 of the disgusting CCNL Multiservizi, increase the profit of Beretta. </p>
<p>With the signing of UIL, the changing contract was concluded without transparency 
 and the guarantees claimed by the Slai Cobas Sc about the lines of 
 processing actually passed to MPM. </p>
<p>The contract thus becomes the Trojan horse to remove one by one lines 
 to the workers who are struggling in the factory with Slai Cobas Sc. 
 They manage more to keep the rhythms of the factory. In recent weeks they are 
 lines 4 and 5 are removed, the control islands, which must return to 
 MPM workers who have been in those positions for years and years. <strong> The contract used 
 To hit 'SottoBanco' the workers. </strong> </p>
<p>With the strike there was a participatory and self -managed by the workers 
 press conference, significantly in front of the ATS headquarters in Trezzo, with 
 Journalists of Milan Today, of the day, those of the Gazzetta della Martesana 
 and of Radio Popolare and some independent ones who carry out investigations on the world 
 of work, all involved by the protagonism of the workers, who have 
 Started with several voices, to tell each other, to say enough, to change. </p>
<p>Unlike what happened so far, with the workers consumed on 
 Beretta processing lines, put out or who have left 
 silence, perhaps recommended by a trade unionist to accept the offer of 
 Conciliation of the company, as inevitable. </p>
<p>The day of January 31, part of a <strong> 360 ° mobilization, as mentioned

<p>Britain is currently paralyzed by hundreds of thousands of workers' strike 
 within the public sector. At the same time there are protests all over 
 the country against the government. </p>
<p>More in 23,000 schools in the country will close when more than 100,000 teachers 
 goes on strike in England and Whales. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/london-uk-16th-jan-2023-protesters-with-placards-protesters-and-speakers-gather-opposite-downing-street-for-the-protect-the-right-to-strike-emergency-demo-including-members-of-the-rmt-t-1.jpeg" />Teachers' strikes hit broadly because another purpose, besides bourgeois 
 Education for the bourgeoisie is that schools act as day care institutions for 
 Children from proletarian families. Without a place to send children to in 
 Working hours have to seek alternatives to get their children cared for. That 
 Reported that any family members will take off on shifts, which also 
 affects other areas of production in the country. </p>
<p>At the same time as the teachers' strike, also university lecturers, shut down, 
 drivers, bus drivers and security guards worked on requirements for higher wages, 
 Better pension and job security. </p>
<p>Furthermore, several mass strikes are expected later this month as tens of thousands of 
 ambulance rescuers across the country go on strike on February 10 as a result 
 of a prolonged struggle for higher wages and more staff. </p>
<p>The strikes and protests also take place against Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and 
 his government's new strike -breaking law that will enable 
 Businesses to fire workers who, under strike, do not perform an 
 'Minimum Service', ie Not least partly works underlining. Rishi and 
 His government tries in vain to follow in the footsteps of margered thatcher 
 strike breakers as they themselves admit the problems that the proletariat's 
 Organization brings them. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/th-4119143806-edited.jpeg" />The British trade union's national organization TUC points out that the British in 
 Average gets the equivalent of 1700 kroner less a month today than 
 They did ten years ago. </p>
<p>At the end of last year, more than 100,000 British nurses launched one 
 Nationwide strike, divided into 76 public hospitals, health centers, 
 Which initiated the first national nursing strike land ever 
 Viewed. The demands of the strike are similar to About the requirements of the nurses in Denmark 
 Back in 2021, with requirements for higher pay. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/th-1179436622-edited.jpeg" />We see how the crisis of imperialism, which is carried by the proletariat, pushes 
 The proletariat in combat and resistance to the attacks on our rights. 
 The proletariat looks through the imperialist bourgeoisis lies and 
 fearmaker as they try to spread about the imperialist war while they 
 uplifting and attacking the proletariat's rights in the name of »the defense of 
 Fort-Europe «.</p>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> The debate continues in and around the party Red, which has so far held on to 
 Sit no to Norwegian weapons for the Zelskiy government. For Norwegian 
 Weapon shipments are of little importance, for all the rest of the Storting 
 supports the government in this case, but for Red the question is still important. </strong> </p>
<p>Central Board Synne Høyforslett Bjørbakk from the party Red is 
 first candidate for the county council elections in Nordland and a member of the government's 
 Defense Commission. The newspaper Klassekampen writes that she disagrees with large parts 
 Of the party leadership in the view of Norwegian weapons to Ukraine. The question of battle should be 
 will be decided at the Red National Meeting held in Stavanger at the end of April. </p>
<p>Government has just chosen to send lephard battle wagons, like several 
 Other European countries. Bjørbakk is concerned that the escalation may lead to 
 Escalation of the war and a dangerous situation becomes even more dangerous. She says 
 That the voltage can increase in the northern areas and that Norway is not served with it. </p>
<p>She says to the Class Fight- "Maybe Ukraine closes. But the war can also end 
 very bad in the sense that the war escalates beyond Ukraine, and 
 Nuclear weapons are used. I think the political debate, and at least 
 The last week, take too lightly on the seriousness of the situation. I miss a critical 
 Publicity that questions whether the finest other action option 
 than sending more weapons ». Bjørbakk is also clear that the war can be 
 Long -lasting, regardless of whether Norway sends weapons or not. </p>
<p>Bjørbakk states that Ukraine leads a legitimate defense war and that the party 
 Supports this, but the war also has a "geopolitical side". She refers to 
 Russia scientist Cecilie Hellestveit and her analysis of the war as "a 
 Land War on Sea, ”where Russia sees it as crucial to have control of the sea 
 in the north and in the south(Svartehavet)To resist pressure from the United States and China, and that the United States 
 Also has its interests. The Red Central Board Member says the war in Ukraine is 
 special, because it has the potential to escalate beyond Ukraine and become a 
 Great war. </p>
<p>Finally, she states that she does not want any new party and does not agree with them 
 Which says this is necessary if Red says yes to weapons. She and several others have 
 signaled this attitude, and thus it looks like it is unlikely 
 that this happens, or that if it happens, it will be a relatively small 
 Shelling. </p>
<p>Earn the people of the media is briefly- Russian imperialism has 
 attacked Ukraine, the Ukrainian nation leads a legitimate liberation struggle, which 
 We support without reservation. Zelskiy's regime is a result of 
 "Orange Revolution" and Euromaidan, in which, among other things, fascist paramilitary 
 And the Yankee imperialism eventually was heavily involved. Zelelskiy is a lakei 
 for mainly the United States, and does not represent the interests of the Ukrainian 
 the nation. US-Nato's support for its Lakei is not in the Ukrainian nation's 
 interest. The main thing for anti -imperialists in Norway is to fight the Russian 
 the imperialism of imperialism and support the Ukrainian people, without becoming a part 
 of US-NATO and Norwegian imperialism's war efforts. </p>

<p>We publish excerpts of an interview with Airaudo Secretary of the CGIL Piedmont </p>
<p><strong> Airaudo- "Now our struggle is to team up also with the top managers" 
 </strong> <strong> The reconfirmed secretary of the CGIL of Piedmont- «The union must 
 Manage the economic agenda »</strong> </p>
<p>«I have not invited the top managers of Michelin and Lavazza to our congress e 
 the vice -president of the Turin industrialists because I became 
 capitalist. But because I believe that the union cannot limit itself to managing the 
 effects of crises but must become the protagonist of the economic agenda e 
 social of a territory ". <strong> Giorgio Airaudo today will be reconfirmed secretary 
 Regional of the CGIL of Piedmont </strong>. </p>
<p><strong> An unusual choice open a CGIL congress by hosting the top 
 manager.</strong> 
 "Far from it. First we talked about peace with Luciana Castellina and work 
 with the delegates. The top managers were there with us because there are no more places 
 Where to establish <strong> a common work agenda ». </strong> </p>
<p><strong> In what sense are the places of debate lack? </strong> 
 "Once upon a time there was Fiat who regulated and managed everything. Then certain routes came 
 drawn in the lounges. Today there is nothing more in Piedmont. The problems are 
 Many must find a way to face them and solve them together ». </p>
<p><strong> Companies then focus on flexibility. </strong> 
 "This has been an emergency for many years. In Italy we have 45 modes 
 contractual entry into the world of work, in Spain have reduced it to 
 two and in fact create jobs. Madrid, among other things, has just adapted 
 salaries at the cost of living, raising the salary of 8 percent. We do not 
 We can not even manage the health crisis ». </p>
<p><strong> Do you need more public investments? </strong> "Certainly. Piedmontese health is 
 to the street. We managed with extreme effort to stabilize a thousand 
 of nurses but it is too little especially for a region that ages 
 quickly". </p>
<p><strong> In fact, today CGIL speaks more about health than Mirafiori. It is a sign of 
 Times? </strong> 
 «We also talked about Mirafiori. I asked the Governor Alberto Lumi 
 Cirio on the agreement between the Region and Stellantis on the Factory Recycling Hub 
 Turin. It is a reserved agreement that we know nothing about. Is between 
 The other from which the union was unexpectedly excluded ».</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/ab-dailies-icc-prosecute-duterte-1024x502-1-800x445.png" /><strong>Marco Valbuena | Chief Information Officer | Communist Party Of The
Philippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 4, 2023</strong></p>
<p>As expected, the Marcos government declared its refusal to cooperate with the
International Criminal Court(ICC)in its plan to commence pretrial
investigation into the charges of crimes against humanity against Rodrigo
Duterte over his sham “war on drugs” during his time in Malacañang.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions are Duterte’s veritable defense lawyers. They are using
the people’s money and the entire Philippine government to stop any and all
effort to make Duterte account for the killing of more than 30,000 people
during the violent spree of police and vigilante operations which he ordered
and incited.</p>
<p>Marcos falsely declares “confidence in the fully functional domestic judicial
system” which clearly has failed to address the aspirations for justice of the
tens of thousands of families clearly who fell victim to Duterte’s carnage.</p>
<p>In Duterte’s defense, the Marcos government hypocritically invokes sovereignty
to stop the ICC from performing its sworn duty as an international body that
closely works with the United Nations and other widely recognized multilateral
agencies.</p>
<p>Marcos and his minions have the least credibility to talk of defending
sovereignty in the face of its continuing failure to assert the country’s
maritime rights in the West Philippine Sea as recognized by the 2016 decision
of the International Arbitral Tribunal.</p>
<p>What defending sovereignty is Marcos talking about when he has not lifted a
finger to end the Mutual Defense Treaty and unequal military treaties with the
United States, and in fact, has acceded to the US plan to construct more
military bases and facilities in AFP camps under the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement(EDCA).</p>
<p>The Filipino people must oppose the Marcos government’s refusal to cooperate
with the ICC, and push the demand for exposing the entire truth about the
bogus “war on drugs,” and for Duterte to be punished for all his crimes.</p>

<p>On March 8 we want to be an important avant -garde, opposition trench 
 unitary, strong, visible women against the masters, the reactionary government 
 that we have, cleric-fascist, with characters within it declaredly 
 sexists. We have already done this on November 26th, but <strong> March 8 is 
 strike!And with the strike, starting from the jobs, let's say clearly that 
 It is a class struggle, a clash between the barbarism of this 
 social system and our bi/dream that all our life must change. </strong> 
 And in this we women, who are doubly exploited, doubly oppressed, 
 When we fight we have an extra gear, because we do not want to miserable and 
 Today increasingly impossible improvements but we want the revolution!</p>
<p>Meloni's government raised the black flag of "God, homeland, 
 family "... and children, because women are" weighed "and can receive some 
 alms only on the basis of the number of children they have and who do for the 
 capital and today for the imperialist war, and prepares to attack 
 heavily abortion, which always accompanies the double oppression and the 
 Modern Middle Ages for women. Today this black flag is the useful ideology 
 to impose misery, war, attack on work, with the inevitable increase in 
 femicides. </p>
<p>This is why this March 8, in these women's strike we must say clearly 
 What we fight for. We do not want a "radical transformation of the system 
 capitalist productive ", we want its reversal!
 Ask equity, ecological transition that respects the environment and 
 our existences, fair distribution, etc. etc. to whom every day at most 
 In the conferences, in the assizes he does "blah, blah, blah"(come dice Greta)And then in 
 Fact takes our lives. </p>
<p>We must bring and fight for a platform that arises from the struggles 
 themselves of the workers, of the precarious workers, of the unemployed, women of 
 neighborhoods. This is the platform that we also propose in this 
 assembly( <em>nota</em> )Today the workers say they no longer do it for the workload, the 
 heavy conditions at work and out of work, in homes. And some are 
 Already transforming this cry on a strike, fight. An important example, 
 Also for the other workers, they are <strong> the workers of Beretta </strong>, who 
 By directly organizing a meeting at the end of October, an assembly 
 different, managed directly by the workers, launch a message of 
 Protagonism, unity, does not delegate, towards other women, workers. </p>
<p><strong> And on February 23 there will be a new assembly, this time electronic, for 
 organize the strike of 8 March on the workplace, to which we call 
 All to be there. </strong> </p>
<p>MFPR </p>
<p>_ We get that the Slai Cobas for the class union has already called 
 Formally the strike of women, open to all workers, of 8 
 March. This notice unionitously covers all workers, too 
 enrolled in other unions or not registered ._ </p>
