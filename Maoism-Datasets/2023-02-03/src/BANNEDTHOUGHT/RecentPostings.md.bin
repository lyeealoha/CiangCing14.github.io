He also\nstrongly criticizes Stalin here for his mistakes in attempting to direct the\nChinese Revolution, and explains why both he and China have not been more\npublicly critical of Stalin so far. However, in the period soon following this\nconversation, it became fully apparent, first, that Yugoslavia was heading in\na revisionist direction (toward so-called [market\nsocialism](https://www.massline.org/Dictionary/MAR.htm#market_socialism)) and,\nsecond, that the Soviet Union was also rapidly becoming revisionist (in the\ndifferent form of [state\ncapitalism](https://www.massline.org/Dictionary/ST.htm#state_capitalism)). As\na consequence, it soon became necessary for Mao and China to criticize\nYugoslavia and the USSR in even more harsh terms than before! And at the same\ntime it became necessary for Mao and China to ease off on their criticisms of\nStalin, who the revisionists were so ferociously attacking.
