**Announcement on the occasion of the death of Comrade** ****_**Farhad**_

(1957 - 2023)

The Central Committee of the C(M)PA with deep sorrow informs all cadres,
members, supporters of the C(M)PA, other Afghan Maoists, and Maoist parties
and organizations in other countries of the world of the news of the death of
Comrade "Farhad", a member of the second regional committee of the C(M)PA,
that passed away due to a heart attack on Friday, January 27, 2023, at the age
of 65.

Comrade "Farhad" was born in 1957 And by tolerating all the sufferings,
hardness and difficulties completed the university with a bachelor's degree in
1980. During his studies, he joined the Shola-e Javid's defenders' group.

Comrade "Farhad" started his struggles against the effete regime of the royal
family in his youth, and after the disgraceful Saur coup of 1357 SH (April
Coup, April 27-28, 1978) and following it on December 1979 with the naked
Invasion of the Russian social-imperialist forces on Afghanistan and their
occupation of the country, He rose up to serious opposition against 7th Saur
coup plotters and continued their political, national-democratic and
revolutionary activities.

Comrade Farhad was chased in 1981 and settled in his hometown which was under
the control of Mujahideen parties and left the country in 1982 and fled to
Iran. during his struggles was in close contact with one of his comrades at
"The Revolutionary Union of Afghanistan Workers" and regularly cooperated with
him.

After the occupation of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, by the imperialist
occupiers led by the occupying US imperialism, he rose up against the
unbridled imperialist occupiers and their puppet regime and began its regular
struggles.

When the process of unification of the communist movement (Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist) started in 2002, supported it, and after the approval of the program
and constitution of the C(M)PA on May 1, 2004, confirmed it and accepted the
membership of the party.

In 2008, he became a member of Regional Committee Number 15, and in 2009, he
took responsibility for the Cultural Committee of Regional Committee Number 15
and advanced this position well since 2011. when the ideological-political
struggle between the C(M)PA and the Revolutionary Communist Party of America
(RCP) intensified in 2011, he firmly supported the position of the C(M)PA, and
called the ''Avakian's new syntheses'' humanistic and revisionist and rejected
it.

When the seminar of the party against the post-Marxist-Leninist-Maoist line
proposed in the manifesto and constitution of the Revolutionary Communist
Party of America was held in the region, Comrade Farhad along with other
comrades of the regional committee took responsibility for the security of the
seminar and until the end of the seminar, this duty carried out well.

In 2014, he could not participate in the second congress of the party due to
his illness, but with his message, he fully supported the process of the
second congress of the C(M)PA.

After the successful processing of the second All-party congress, comrade
Farhad became a member of the regional committee number (02). He carried this
responsibility well since 2019. when the issue of the Qatar peace process was
raised in 2019, Comrade Farhad took a decisive and principled stance against
the Taliban at the level of regional number two.

After Comrade Zia's death, he gave the youth fighting morale and always
reminded them that the young generation should fill the empty places of the
old comrades and advised the comrades that new blood should flow in the veins
of the party.

He participated in the first anniversary of Comrade Zia's death, which was
organized at the regional level, and wrote a poem about Comrade Zia under the
title "You're gone and the grass went away from the spring field." which is
included in the Persian part of party's website and publications.

Comrade Farhad was a capable poet, critic, and pundit and a good writer for
the party's publications. He discussed the issues of the day from an
ideological-political point of view in every meeting.

Unfortunately, death did not allow this valuable comrade, and was taken from
us at the age of 65 due to a heart attack on Friday, January 27, 2023.

**Comrades** :

Let's turn the sadness caused by the death of Comrade "Farhad" into a
struggling force and keep his memory as a Maoist revolutionary alive and
lasting.

**May his memory be blessed and may his path be bright and red!**
