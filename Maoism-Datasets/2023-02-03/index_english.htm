 -oprile 22- from the Guardia di Finanza 'against illegal use by 
 Beretta delle Cooperatives to always have manpower available 
 available and underpaid, explicitly defined as a transhumance of 
 workers', as a facade and commercial operation; How to download on

 results of the exploitation of precarious work and underpaid of the contract, 
 of the disgusting CCNL Multiservizi, increase the profit of Beretta. </p>
<p>With the signing of UIL, the changing contract was concluded without transparency 
 and the guarantees claimed by the Slai Cobas Sc about the lines of 
 processing actually passed to MPM. </p>
<p>The contract thus becomes the Trojan horse to remove one by one lines 
 to the workers who are struggling in the factory with Slai Cobas Sc. 
 They manage more to keep the rhythms of the factory. In recent weeks they are
MPM workers who have been in those positions for years and years. <strong> The contract used 
 To hit 'SottoBanco' the workers. </strong> </p>
<p>With the strike there was a participatory and self -managed by the workers 
 press conference, significantly in front of the ATS headquarters in Trezzo, with 
 Journalists of Milan Today, of the day, those of the Gazzetta della Martesana 
 and of Radio Popolare and some independent ones who carry out investigations on the world 
 of work, all involved by the protagonism of the workers, who have 
 Started with several voices, to tell each other, to say enough, to change. </p>
<p>Unlike what happened so far, with the workers consumed on 
 Beretta processing lines, put out or who have left 
 silence, perhaps recommended by a trade unionist to accept the offer of 
 Conciliation of the company, as inevitable. </p>

 Transcription for <a href="http-//www.resistenze.org">Resistance.org</a>edited by the Center 
 of culture and popular documentation </p>
<p><em>In the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union a 
 Stalingrad on the Nazi -fascist invaders</em> </p>
<p>At the beginning of the winter 1942-1943 it opened on the banks of the Volga and Don one 
 New stage of the mortal struggle against Nazifascism, entry into history 
 like the period of the radical turning point throughout the second war 
 world. The main merit of the realization of this turning point in favor 
 of the anti -fascist coalition belongs to the Soviet Union. 
 In the avid battles of 1942-1943 on the Soviet-German front yes 
 the historical destinies not only of the Soviet people decided, but of the whole 
 humanity. </p>
<p><strong> 1 . The defeat of the fascist troops on the Volga. The beginning of the turning point 
 radical in the war </strong> </p>
<p>The situation at the beginning of the counter -offensive of Soviet troops on 
 Southern </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 the Soviet-German front, with the exception of some sectors, 
 He stabilized throughout the line from the sea of Barents on the slopes of the Caucasus. 
 However, the situation continued to be extremely serious for the union 
 Soviet. Leningrad was besieged, great enemy forces continued to 
 operate on the distant access routes to Moscow, the incessant rough 
 Stalingrad fights always absorbed new forces, the main streets 
 of communication with the Caucasus were interrupted. 
 The situation on the seas was also unfavorable for the Soviet armed forces. 
 The Baltic fleet was blocked in the eastern part of the Gulf of 
 Finland. The Black Sea fleet, after the loss of the Crimea peninsula e 
 of ninotorossijsk, he was forced to lead to inadequate ports such as those of 
 Poti, Gelendžik and Tuapse, and this hindered his actions. In more conditions 
 The North fleet was favorable. Reinforced with ships made 
 from the Pacific Ocean, it defended northern communications and 
 He lent a valid help to terrestrial troops in the defense of the coast. </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 it became clear that the plans of the summer-autumn campaign 
 of the Nazi command had failed. Although the German troops and theirs 
 allies had arrived on the Volga and were on the slopes of the Caucasus, 
 They had not achieved their main objective. The advance 
 of the summer, about a million men had cost the Nazi Germany between 
 killed, injured and prisoners as well as the loss of a huge amount of 
 means and armaments. </p>
<p>The German Armies group "A", having met an avid resistance 
 by the Soviet troops on the slopes of the Caucasus, he was busy 
 in long and exhausting fights. The "B" Army Group had to get used to 
 On a headquarters of the length of 1,300 km. In the center of the arch, of 
 In front of Stalingrado, there were the VI armed by Von Paulus and the IV Army 
 Hath's battleship, which fought for the conquest of the city. To theirs 
 wings were lined up by the III and the IV Romanian armies and the VIII Italian Army, 
 Go to the defensive. The satellite troops were weaker from the point of 
 Military and moral view of the German ones. </p>
<p>The situation of the troops of the fascist attackers who were under 
 Stalingrado and in the North Caucasus was aggravated by the fact that their reserves 
 strategic were almost completely exhausted. On the boundless forehead 
 Eastern, which extended for over 6,000 km, there were in the reserve of 
 central command of German terrestrial troops only three divisions 
 battleships, a spare division and two infantry brigades; in the reserve 
 There were eight divisions of the armed groups and a brigade. </p>
<p>In October 1942 the German command, considering the situation compromised, 
 He made the decision to move on to the defensive. In order n. 1 of 14 October 
 1942 was arranged- "We have to face the winter campaign. The task of 
 Eastern front - in addition to the current offensive operations or designed 
 - is to keep the positions achieved at any cost, reject each 
 attempt by the enemy to break them through and thus create the conditions for 
 continue our offensive in 1943 in order to defeat 
 definitively our most dangerous enemy ". </p>
<p>On the basis of these provisions, the German armed forces began i 
 preparations for the winter. On the entire length of the front they were built 
 or strengthen the fortifications. 
 Particular attention was paid to the central front of the front, where 
 The Wehrmacht command was expected offensive actions of the red army. 
 Here the main reinforcements to detrose the groupings were concentrated 
 of the other areas. At the beginning of the winter campaign, in the group of armies
to which the Germans placed on the eastern front. The Hitler General Staff 
 he believed that the offensive of the red army against the group of armies 
 central would have been launched at the beginning of November. </p>
<p>For its part, the Soviet supreme command, in perfecting the plans 
 of the winter offensive, had decided to launch the main blow in the 
 Southern sector with the forces of the south-west front(comandate dal tenente-
generale Vatutin), of the Don front(comandate dal tenente-genera­le
Rokossovski)and the Stalingrad front(comandate dal colonnello-generale
Eremenko)starting from the Stalingrado area with a single direction to the 
 Basin of the Don. To prepare the counter -offensive and coordinate the actions of 
 Fronti were sent to the Stalingrad area the general of the army Zukov e 
 The Colonellogeneral Vassilevski. </p>
<p>The opportunity to start the attack in this sector was dictated by 
 A set of political, economic and military factors. The decisive defeat 
 of the enemy in the South had to lead to the definitive collapse of his plans that 
 they focused on the arrival of the German troops in the Caucasus and the entrance of the 
 Turkey in the war against the Soviet Union. Obtaining decisive results 
 soldiers in the South, the very rich cereal areas of the 
 Don and Kuban, the conditions for the liberation of the 
 Basin of the Don, and the enemy threat to the sources of 
 oil of the Caucasus and the communication routes with the allies that 
 Through Iran they reached the Persian Gulf. The Don Basin sector 
 The most vulnerable point in German strategic defense appeared. </p>
<p>With the arrival of the Soviet troops in Rostov the conditions for 
 The defeat of the German armored group "A", which operated in the Caucasus 
 northern. The defeat of the enemy in the territory between the Volga and the Don 
 It was only to be the first stage of the winter campaign. After success 
 of this operation the Soviet Supreme Command calculated to perform one 
 series of offensive operations on other fronts. Particular importance 
 was given to the elimination of the siege of Leningrado and the defeat of the 
 grouping of the enemy in the areas of Demjansk, Ržev-Vjazma, in the course 
 Superior of the Don and in the northern Caucasus. </p>
<p>The first phase of the winter campaign was designed in the most complete way 
 It is accurate. With the joint efforts of the General Staff of the Command 
 supreme, of the general staff and the command of the fronts of 
 Stalingrado, Del Don and South-West, a plan was developed that received the 
 Name of "Uranus". This plan was based on a very bold idea- with the 
 forces of the three fronts surround and destroy the great grouping of 
 Fascist troops in the territory between the Volga and Don and create the conditions 
 For the passage of the Soviet Armed Forces to the strategic offensive 
 general on the southern wing and on the other sectors of the Soviet front- 
 German. The assault groups of the south-west front and the front of 
 Stalingrad they had to attack by converging on Kalač and Sovjetskij and then tighten 
 In this area the ring of the bag where the troops of the 
 attackers. 
 The defense of the enemy had to be broken in the most vulnerable sectors, which 
 They were held by the Romanian troops. </p>
<p>The beginning of the offensive was set for the south-west fronts of the Don at 19 
 November, for the Stalingrad front to the next day. To implement the 
 "Uranus operation" was needed a huge organizational activity to put the 
 Troops in full efficiency in view of the fighting. It was necessary 
 First of all strengthen the fronts with men, weapons, military vehicles and 
 provisions; Create operational and strategic reserves; perfect the 
 political-military preparation of troops; to secret i 
 assault groupings in the starting areas of the operation; organize 
 their coordination and their direction. The preparations were complicated 
 from the fact that the transport of men and means took place under the 
 continuous bombing from the air on three unique railways, a fact that 
 He limited the speed of influx. A particular difficulty in guaranteeing the 
 secrecy of the concentration of forces was represented by the character 
 mainly stepping of the areas where the next one would have launched 
 offensive. </p>
<p>The success of the operations depended primarily on the actions of the 
 battleship and mechanized units. Therefore, on the eve of the offensive the fronts 
 they were strengthened with units and warts of tanks. Overall in 
 Three fronts about 900 tanks were aligned. Over 13,500 cannons e 
 Mortai were made available to artillery, twice as many as those 
 They had been employed in the counter -offensive of Moscow. The aviation counted more 
 of 1,000 airplanes. </p>
<p>On the eve of the offensive Soviet troops lined up on the three fronts do not
the skilled dislocation of the forces and vehicles in the directors of the attacks 
 main, the Soviet command managed to create powerful blocks of troops. 
 All these forces and means were previously lined up on the positions 
 attack thanks to the work organized in the rear. </p>
<p>On the Volga, from Saratov to Astrachan, 50 worked 50 
 Steam ferries. Numerous boats bridges were built. The 
 concentration of the forces passed unnoticed by the enemy- the divisions in 
 march maintained the most absolute radio silence, all orders 
 they were given to voice. Measures were also widely used for 
 disorient the enemy. Great help offered the military commands the 
 population and organizations of the Communist Party of the Region of 
 Stalingrado. The workers of the Region contributed to the refueling of 
 Troops with food and ammunition. Tens of thousands of citizens worked on the 
 construction of airports, bridges on rivers and roads, helped transport the 
 ammunition and to repair military vehicles. In mid -November i 
 Preparations for the "Uranus operation" had been completed. The red army 
 She was ready to inflict the decisive blow to the enemy. </p>
<p>The encirclement and defeat of German forces in Stalingrado </p>
<p>On November 19, at 8.50 in the morning, after a massive bombing of the 
 artillery, the troops of the south-west fronts and don triggered 
 to the offensive. </p>
<p>An intense snowfall and the morning fog prevented the intervention 
 aviation. After breaking the resistance of the Romanian troops of the 
 III Army, the assault group of the south-west front managed to 
 advance at the end of the first day of fights of 30-35 km. 
 At the same time they penetrated deeply in the enemy defensive device 
 also the troops of the Don front. From the morning of November 20, in conditions 
 unfavorable meteorological, the Stalingrad front passed to the attack. After 
 having broken the defense of the Romanian army south of the city, the troops 
 Soviets went north-west and south-west. </p>
<p>The German command made desperate efforts to arrest the offensive of the 
 Soviet troops, but all attempts to block it or even just 
 slowing it down completely. The mobile units of the south-west fronts and of 
 Stalingrado advanced quickly they reached the wings of the German VI army, 
 Making the threat of lighter weigh on the enemy grouping. </p>
<p>On November 23, the 4th Soviet armored body of the south-west front al 
 command of the major-general A. Kravčenko joined as foreseen in the 
 area of the village of Sovjetskij with the 4th mechanized body of the front of 
 Stalingrado commanded by the major-general V.T. Volski, making it so 
 the encirclement of a large group of enemy strong of 22 
 Divisions. Of the moving units of the two fronts. </p>
<p>In order not to allow the ring to break by the grouping 
 surrounded or its release from the outside, the Soviet troops continued 
 the advance to expand the corridor established between the German troops in the 
 First phase of the operation. Successfully rejecting the counterattacks of the 
 enemy, they arrived on the evening of November 30 on the line of the FUUs Čir and Don. 
 In the meantime, active shares were also conducted on the internal front 
 lighter. On the evening of 30 November the surface occupied by 
 surrounded grouping had already reduced more than half and did not exceed 
 By now 1,500 sq km. This sector was massively hammered by the fire 
 of Soviet artillery. </p>
<p>On November 22, even before the encirclement was completed, the 
 commander of the GENCE VI General Army von Paulus summoned Gumrak la 
 meeting of the commanders of the bodies, who unanimously came to the 
 conclusion that a long defensive struggle within the gigantic bag 
 would lead to the catastrophe and that to avoid it it was necessary to go 
 immediately with the bulk of the forces south-west. General von 
 Paulus asked Hitler for authorization to break the encirclement south 
 west, but obtained an inflexible refusal accompanied by the promise that 
 All measures would have been taken to ensure normal refueling 
 of the Army and at the same time free it from lighter. </p>
<p>At the end of November and in the first days of December the Germans made a 
 First attempt to free the surrounded divisions, launching a counterattack 
 in the area of the southwest front. But the advance of the German wagons was blocked 
 And rejected. </p>
<p>In an attempt to restore the situation in the South, the German command decided 
 to quickly create a new group of "Don" armies, in which they were 
 including troops operating in the great Ansa of Don, together with the group 
 of armies surrounded in the Stalingrado area.
assigned the task of arresting the offensive of Soviet troops and, 
 attacking from the areas of Kotelnikovo and Torre to Stalingrado, of 
 reach the surrounded troops, join them and restore the previous one 
 defense front. The refueling of the surrounded grouping would have been 
 insured by air. </p>
<p>The Soviet command promptly sensed the enemy's plans and prepared 
 effectively to reject its counterattacks- he strengthened his own 
 groupings that operated on the external front of the "corridor", organized the 
 Hunt against enemy transport aviation. In December they were destroyed 
 In the air or at airports over 750 German transport planes. 
 The annihilation of Von Paulus' army was entrusted to the Don front, 
 commanded by the Rokossovski Lieutenant-General. The General Staff of the Command 
 Supreme was represented by the Colonel-General Voronov. However the 
 realization of this goal had to be provisionally postponed. </p>
<p>On 12 December from the district of Kotelnikovo, along the Tichoreck railway 
 Stalingrado, began to advance the 57th armored body of the armed group 
 Hoth. Under the strong pressure of the predominant enemy forces, the army 
 of the Stalingrad front, which operated on this line, was forced to 
 retire north-east. However, on December 15 he managed to arrest 
 the German advance and in the following days heroically resisted the 
 pressure of the enemy. On 19 December the Hath Army Group resumed 
 the offensive and on 23 December reached the Flume Myškova, at a distance of 
 About 40 km from the troops of the VI Army surrounded. </p>
<p>To reject the enemy offensive, it was sent to the Kotelnikovo area 
 The Army of the Guard commanded by the Lieutenant-General Rodion Malinovski, 
 previously intended for the liquidation of the enemy grouping 
 surrounded. In the harsh conditions of Russian winter the troops of Malinovski 
 they went with a forced march of 40-50 km per day to the river 
 Myškova, where the enemy tried to expand his bridge head. As soon as 
 Arriving in contact with the enemy the Soviet army attacked him with a momentum 
 without stopping. </p>
<p>On December 24, the Malinovski army passed to the offensive with an action 
 coordinated with a part of the forces of the V -armed assault and the LI 
 Army. 
 After breaking the German resistance, Soviet troops occupied the 
 December 29 Kotelnikovo. The goal of preventing the 
 New attempt by the enemy to unlock the army of Von Paulus, closed 
 irremediably in the stingrado bag, which now appeared condemned 
 without escape to total destruction. </p>
<p>The troops of the fronts of Voronež and of 
 southwest. On the morning of December 16, after an hour and a half of fire of 
 artillery, the troops of the fronts of Voronež and south-west broke the 
 defense of the enemy in some points and on the evening of December 24 they had 
 made an advance of 100-200 kilometers. In eight days of hard 
 fights they influence a severe defeat to the Italian eighth army e 
 to the left wing of the group of "Don" armies, thus creating a threat of 
 deep encirclement from the north of the bulk of his strength. </p>
<p>On 30 December Soviet troops advanced deeply in the rear 
 of the enemy on the Nikolskaja-Ilinka line. In an attempt to arrest 
 The advance of the fronts of Voronež and south-west, the German command was 
 forced to hurry 8 divisions previously intended 
 At the release of the troops of Von Paulus. At the beginning of January 1943 the 
 Situation of the troops closed in the bag greatly worse. The ring 
 of the lighter narrowed more and more. The Germans were missing reserves 
 of any kind. The ammunition and fuel were about to end. THE 
 moral of the surrounded troops was very low even if the soldiers continued 
 to fight. </p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid a useless bloodshed on January 8, 1943 
 The Soviet command offered the surrender to Von Paulus with the honor of arms, 
 proposing to cease the senseless resistance. Always hoping for the arrival 
 of the "rescue" army and in obedience under the orders of Hitler, von Paulus 
 He rejected the generous offer. On January 10, 1943 the troops of the Don front 
 They then moved on to the annihilation of the surrounded grouping. </p>
<p>Exceeding the strong resistance of the enemy, the troops of the front came on the 17th 
 January in Voroponovo; The Soviet command proposed again to Von Paulus di 
 give up. But this proposal was also rejected. </p>
<p>The troops of the Don front continued the attacks and on January 25 the 
 Soviet avant -garde arrived in Stalingrad from the West. In the evening of 26 
 January the troops of the XXI Army joined the hill area 
 of Mamai to the troops of the LXII Army, thus breaking the
Many soldiers began to surrender. </p>
<p>On January 31, the resistance of the group was definitively broken 
 southern and on February 2 that of the northern part of the Army of 
 von Paulus. </p>
<p>The troops of the Don front had annihilated 22 divisions, doing 
 Prisoners 91 thousand between soldiers and officers with the same marshal von 
 Paulus(Hitler lo aveva promosso sul campo sperando così di indurlo a non
arren­dersi e a sacrificare fino all'ultimo i suoi sol­dati)and conquering 
 A large amount of weapons and military means. During the offensive, 
 Duration two and a half months, 5 armed armed were disfigured 
 fascists. The losses in men of the German troops and allies exceeded, from 
 November 19, 1942 to February 2, 1943, 800 thousand men. During the same period 
 The red army destroyed or captured 2,000 tanks and self -propelled cannons, 
 over 10 thousand cannons and mortars, 2,000 combat and transport planes, 
 Over 70 thousand vehicles. </p>
<p>The general offensive of the Red Army in winter 1942-1943 </p>
<p>The victory over the Volga decidedly borrowed the strategic situation on the whole 
 Soviet-German and first of all in its southern sector. The 
 Soviet supreme command decided, making new forces enter into action 
 expand the front of the strategic offensive. The development of the 
 counter -offensive in general offensive began even before the complete 
 annihilation of the German grouping surrounded on the Volga. 
 Overall, for the general offensive of the winter campaign 1942-1943, 
 Over 70% of all forces and means of the army was used 
 Soviet fighter. The strategic offensive developed on a front of 
 3,000 km and for a depth of 600-700 km. </p>
<p>Thus began the expulsion of the occupants from the Soviet territory. The 
 General Staff of the Soviet Supreme Command approved the offensive plan 
 of the troops of the south fronts and the Caucasus, with the aim of surrounding e 
 Destroy the German grouping that operated on the Caucasian front. In 
 based on this plan, the troops of the south front, in command of the colonel- 
 General Eremenko had to take to the Rostov area and cut the street 
 of the retreat to the North-Caucasian grouping of the Wehrmacht. </p>
<p>The left wing of this front had to attack towards Tichoreck through 
 the steppes of Salsk, so as not to allow the retreat of the enemy towards the 
 Taman peninsula. The troops of the Caucasus front, in command of the general 
 armed I. Tjulenev, they had to attack with the forces of the Mar Group 
 Black to Krasnodar and further on Tichoreck, and, together with the troops 
 of the south front, surround the group of the grouping in this area 
 North-Caucasian German. </p>
<p>At the same time, he was ordered to the northern group of the troops of the 
 front of the Caucasus to push, advanced with his right wing 
 Through Mozdok in the direction of Armavir, the bulk of the I Armored Army 
 German towards the slopes of the Caucasian central chain and then 
 destroy it. </p>
<p>On January 1, 1943, the troops of the south front passed to the execution of the 
 plan. When, after passing the strong resistance of the enemy, they 
 They arrived at the Manyč river, the group of German armies "a" found himself closed in 
 a deep bag, and, in order not to be isolated, began to retire 
 Quickly towards Rostov. </p>
<p>On January 3, the northern group of troops of the Caucasian front 
 The chasing of the retreating units of the I Armored Army began 
 German. However, the rhythm of its advance was insufficient. After 
 northern group, the advance group of the Black Sea also began which 
 operated in the difficult conditions of winter in the mountains, without being able to 
 count, due to bad weather, on the approval of aviation. In January, 
 overcoming the resistance of the enemy and the mountains, the troops of this 
 Group freed Nalčik, Stavropol, Armavir and numerous other locations. </p>
<p>A great help to the troops gave the partisans of Stavropolle direct, from 
 Party Committee of the Region. The patriots attacked the Hitlerians, 
 they destroyed or seized their means, bridges, deposits, 
 locomotives, wagons, also freeing several locations. The group 
 northern of the troops of the Caucasus front, under the command of the lieutenant 
 General I. I. Maslennikov, entered action on January 24, 1943 on the front of 
 Caucasus of the North. </p>
<p>Overcoming the resistance of the enemy, the impracticability of the places and the 
 Bad weather, the troops reached the sea of Azov in early February. In the 
 head of the Kuban bridge, the XVII German army was isolated, which he could now 
 maintain connections with the bulk of the Nazi forces only 
 through Crimea. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the armies of the South front fought in the surroundings of Rostov. A 
 remarkable part of the northern Caucasus was freed, but it was not possible to
With the arrival, at the end of January 1943, of Soviet troops nearby 
 of Rostov, the enemy's resistance increased. The German command appeared 
 desperate efforts to earn the time necessary for the withdrawal of 
 own forces from the Caucasus of the North. Avid fights took place in the 
 area of the Bataisk railway station, 10 km from Rostov, through the 
 Which Germans transported men and means. </p>
<p>The offensive of the troops of the Black Sea Group also developed. The 4 
 February they arrived at the Kuban river and near Krasnodar. For 
 take possession of ninational and the Taman peninsula, on the night of 4 
 February the command of the front of the Caucasus of the North and the fleet of the Mar 
 Nero went on to implement a great landing operation in the Jušnaja area 
 Osereika. However, welcomed by the strong fire of the enemy and having immediately strong 
 leaks, a part of the landing ships was forced to retire, while the 
 Troops already landed were unable to keep the head of the bridge because 
 of the inequality of forces. </p>
<p>The result of the landing of the reinforcement troops was more favorable, in command 
 of Major Z. L. Kunikov, in the area of the village of Stanička and the mountain 
 Myšako, near Novorossijsk. This shipment consisting of 800 men 
 of the Marina infantry, quickly reinforced with other departments, occupied and 
 He firmly kept a small bridge head. </p>
<p>The Hitler's Friendly Staff, including the danger that looked out on the 
 Grouping of Nincoossijsk, he gave order to drive at any cost in 
 Soviet soldiers. Against modest Soviet troops they were 
 concentrated the effective of 5 German divisions. </p>
<p>However, their efforts coated against the value of the infantry from Marina 
 Soviet. A struggle began that had to last seven months in the head of 
 Myšako bridge, which was called "small land". For all of this 
 period never ceased fighting with the enemy who used wagons 
 armed, artillery and aviation. </p>
<p>The defenders of the "little land" covered themselves with glory, writing a pages 
 of authentic heroism in the history of the great patriotic war. Troops 
 Krasnot and, on February 12, on February 12, 
 facing bitter fighting, they continued the advance along the banks of the 
 Kuban and the Western Caucasus towards the Taman peninsula. Meanwhile the 
 Troops of the south front attacked the enemy lines in front of Rostov. In the 
 Axis of the city a fierce battle developed. </p>
<p>On February 14, after a few days of harsh fights, Rostov came 
 freed. Following the offensive, the regions of the Ceceno- were freed 
 Inguscezia, of northern obvious, of the Cabardino-Balcaria, the 
 territory of Stavropol, and a large part of the region of Rostov and the 
 territory of Krasnodar. In these regions they lived before the war 10 
 million of people. The German invaders brought enormous damage 
 The economy of the area killed many thousands of Soviet citizens. In the 
 Only territory of Stavropol, they made themselves responsible for the massacre, of over 30 
 thousand civilians </p>
<p>Simultaneously with the offensive of the Soviet troops of the North Caucasus 
 Offensive operations were launched in the Ostrogožsk-Rossošk areas, e 
 Voronež-Kestornoje. </p>
<p>In the second half of January 1943 the troops of the Voronež front, al 
 command of the Lieutenant-General F. I. Golikov, surrounded and destroyed a 
 Strong enemy grouping attested on the Don between Voronež and Kantamirovka. </p>
<p>The main blow was inflicted on the II Hungarian army and the VIII Army 
 Italian, located in this area. During the operations they were 
 Over 15 divisions completely destroyed, while 6 divisions came 
 severely affected. Over 86 thousand between soldiers and enemy officers were made 
 prisoners. 
 Soviet troops advanced 140 km towards Flume Oskol. </p>
<p>Then the troops of the right wing of the Voronež front and the left wing of the 
 front of Brjansk attacked and defeated the grouping in Kastornoje 
 Enemy of the Voronež-Kastornoje line. Only a few groups of soldiers 
 they managed to escape the lighter. During this operation they came 
 11 enemy divisions destroyed. The troops of the fronts of Brjansk and Voronež 
 they freed a large part of the regions of Voronež of Kursk, the cities of 
 Voronež, Kastornoje, Staryi Oskol and Tim. </p>
<p>In these two operations in the upper course of the Don the Group of Armies 
 German "B" suffered a tough defeat. Very serious losses suffered the armies 
 of the satellites of Germany(Ungheria e Italia)The II Hungarian army was of 
 Destroyed fact, having lost 135 thousand men. The same fate touched the eighth 
 Italian Army. Having completely lost the combative ability, it 
 It was withdrawn from the Soviet-German front. The defeat of the armies 
 Hungarian and Italian produced a strong impression in Hungary and Italy e
Satellite countries of Germany. </p>
<p>Developing their offensive, Soviet troops occupied on February 8th 
 Kursk and February 16 Charkov. In the meantime, the troops of the south-west front, 
 At the command of the Colonellogeneral Vatutin, they launched an attack towards 
 Mariupol, to cut the retreat west to the enemy grouping of 
 Basin of the Don. </p>
<p>The partial withdrawal of enemy troops from the lower course of the Don Verso 
 Mius and the movements made by the Germans in the Donec basin were 
 erroneously evaluated by the command of the south-west fronts and by Voronež as 
 The beginning of a general retreat of fascist troops beyond the Dnepr. The 
 General Staff of the Supreme Command agreed with this evaluation. In such 
 way, despite the troops of these fronts had been weakened and had 
 urgent need for reinforcements, their offensive was forced in all 
 Maniere. For its part, the Nazi command designed a great counter -offensive 
 in this sector. </p>
<p>On February 13, the German armored group "Don" was transformed into a group 
 of "south" armies, which was hastily strengthened with units made 
 from Western Europe, from the Balkans, and other sectors of the front 
 Soviet-German. A meeting was held in Zaporžje in the presence of Hitler 
 of the supreme command of the Wehrmacht. The plan was approved in the meeting 
 of the counter-offensive, which provided for the attack on the troops of the southern front 
 West, marching towards the Dnepr, to reject them beyond the northern Don. 
 The plan also involved the encirclement of Soviet troops in the area 
 by Charkov, and, after their defeat, the penetration into the rear of the 
 Front of Voronež and an advance towards Kursk. </p>
<p>At the same time from the area south of ORël he had to start an offensive 
 Against the rear of the Soviet central front, to surround the troops 
 of the red army concentrated in the Kursk area. On the eve of 
 Operations The "South" German Armies Group had 31 divisions, 13 
 of which were battleship or motorized, that is, half of all units 
 Furniture operating on the Soviet-German front. To truth, the divisions 
 Nazi, especially the battleships, were incomplete in men and in 
 means. </p>
<p>The counter-offensive against the right wing of the south-west front began on the 19th 
 February. Under the pressure of the predominant enemy forces the troops 
 Soviet were forced to retire to northern Donec. 
 Subsequently the German units attack the advanced troops of the wing 
 left of the Voronež front. Soviet troops bravely drew up 
 every palm of soil. On these days he received the baptism of fire 
 On Voronež front the Czechoslovak battalion in command of the Colonel 
 Ludvik Svoboda. </p>
<p>On March 13, the Germans occupied Charkov again and rejected the troops 
 of the left wing of the Voronež front towards Belgorod creating a situation 
 difficult not only for this front, but also for the rear of the front 
 central. The major staff of the Soviet supreme command then moved towards 
 The areas threatened the reserves with which, towards the end of March, it came 
 The German counter -offensive arrested. On the whole southern wing of the front 
 Soviet-German from Belgorod to the sea of Azov both armies passed 
 on the defensive. </p>
<p>The German command was unable to achieve its goals, even if with the 
 his offensive had managed to re-occupy a part of the north-eastern areas and 
 Oriental of Ukraine. But these successes cost a very high price. 
 One of the main objectives achieved by Soviet troops in 
 Winter campaign 1942-1943 was the elimination of the siege of Leningrado. The 
 breakdown of the fortified defense of the enemy was made by the troops 
 of the Leningrado front, under the command of the Lieutenant-General L. A. Govorov and from 
 Those of the Volchov front, under the command of the Army General K. A. Merezkov. </p>
<p>For the offensive, the sector south of Lake Ladoga was chosen along the line 
 German Schlüsselburg-Sinjavino. The attacks of the troops of the two fronts 
 they were concerted in order to take the Germans between two fires and from 
 allow the combination of the soldiers of the red army for the most way 
 brief. </p>
<p>By understanding the strategic importance of this sector, the Hitlerians VI 
 concentrated large forces well trained in actions in forest areas- 
 marshy. 
 In the space of a long period the Germans had built a series of 
 Powerful fortifications defensed in Scaglioni. The assault on these positions was 
 extremely difficult. After completing long and accurate preparations, 
 The troops of the fronts of Leningrado and Volchov passed to the offensive on 12 
 January 1943. </p>
<p>At the breakdown of the siege, the sailors of the fleet of the 
 Baltic(comandati dal viceammiraglio V. Tribuz)and of the war flotilla
fighting Soviet troops were reason for the defense of the enemy e 
 On January 18 they joined the area of the suburbs workers n. 1 and n. 5. 
 The siege of Leningrado was broken. Along the southern coast of the lake 
 Ladoga was formed an 8-11 km wide corridor, along which the city was able to 
 restore the connection to the ground with the rest of the country. In this 
 Corridor was built in a short time a railway that in February 1943 
 He entered into operation. The Leningradesis called her "Victory Railway". </p>
<p>The breakdown of the siege made the Leningrad situation less precarious. For 18 
 months the lengledesi, enduring unspeakable privations, had been 
 subjected to a complete siege by the enemy. Overall, 
 Especially in the first winter of the siege, they had died of hunger and for the 
 Enemy attacks over 600 thousand inhabitants. </p>
<p>But the Leningradesi resisted. For the whole world the defense of Leningrado 
 He became the symbol of the will of the Soviet people to win the enemy. 
 The President of the United States of America Roosevelt, in the diploma sent to 
 Leningrado, wrote- "On behalf of the people of the United States of America I deliver 
 This diploma to the city of Leningrado in memory of its valiant 
 fighters and his faithful inhabitants, men, women and children, who isolated 
 by the remaining part of their people and despite the continuous bombings e 
 The unspeakable suffering caused by hunger, cold and diseases defended 
 successfully their dear city in the critical period from 8 September 1941 to 
 January 18, 1943, thus rising to a symbol of the invincible spirit of the 
 peoples of the Union of Soviet socialist republics and all 
 peoples of the world that oppose the forces of aggression ". The deeds 
 of the heroic defenders of the city of Lenin have remained impressed forever 
 in the memory of the peoples of the world. </p>
<p>In February and March 1943 in the central and northwestern sectors of the 
 in front of offensive operations were carried out for the liquidation of two 
 Outposts of the enemy, deeply under the troop device 
 Soviet. On February 15, 1943 the troops of the North-West front in command of the 
 Marshal Timošenko and the III armed assault on the Kalinin front 
 The offensive began against the units of the XVI German Army, attested 
 in the "Demjansk bag", without however being able to surround and destroy the 
 enemy troops. The Germans, suffering strong losses, escaped 
 to lighter. </p>
<p>In the fights north of Velikije-Luki, on February 23, on the day 
 anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army, he made a heroic enterprise the 
 Nineteen -year -old young communist Aleksandr matrossov. He obstructed with his 
 body a mitraglia's slit of an enemy fort and immolated its own 
 life guaranteed the success of his platoon. The name of Aleksandr matrossov, 
 Hero of the Soviet Union, is forever registered in the honor of the 254th 
 guard infantry regiment, which bears its name. </p>
<p>The troops of the West fronts and Kalinin developed an offensive in March 
 towards Ržev-Vjazma. Under the attacks of Soviet troops and fear 
 Threat of encirclement, the enemy was forced to retreat. The line 
 of the front was thus not only removed from another 130-160 km from Moscow to 
 West, but also Rercherciata. </p>
<p>The political-military importance of the winner of the Army 
 Red in the winter campaign 1942-1943 </p>
<p>For 4 and a half months, from mid -November 1942 to the end of March 1943, yes 
 the winter campaign continued, which register great victories 
 of the red army. A central place had in this campaign 
 the encirclement and annihilation of enemy troops on the Volga. </p>
<p>After supporting the pressure of fascist troops in the summer of 1942, 
 The Red Army inflicted on them a decisive blow. As had happened at 
 Moscow, in the difficult conditions of defensive fighting, was prepared 
 A counter -offensive of Soviet troops on a strategic scale. However the 
 situation in which the winter campaign 1942-1943 began and took place, yes 
 It substantially distinguished from the situation of winter 1941-1942. Under Moscow 
 The defeat of the German troops was obtained in a situation in which the 
 Economic and military resources of the country were far from being 
 completely used, while the rear were in a situation 
 extremely difficult. </p>
<p>The Red Army, having suffered enormous losses in men and means in the summer 
 1941, could not yet ensure a decisive superiority on the enemy and launched 
 the counter -offensive by having very limited forces and means. This was one 
 of the main causes for which the battle in front of Moscow was unable to 
 realize the encirclement and destruction of great enemy forces. </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 the situation was different. In the country there was already a
of summer 1942, to supply the army of the necessary quantity of means 
 and armaments. The solidity of the rear, the rapid and energetic mobilization 
 of the entire economy for the needs of the war, the work of the people, 
 directed by the Communist Party, they were the premise that he assured the army 
 Red the opportunity to move on to the counter -offensive. </p>
<p>The Soviet armed forces, tempered in previous battles, equipped with 
 experience and of great combative skills, they could now face and 
 Solve offensive tasks on a strategic scale. No occasional causes, but the 
 solidity of the socialist regime, awareness of duty by 
 all the people and their high patriotism, allowed the Soviet Union 
 not only to resist in the hard struggle, but also to turn the course of the course 
 all world war in favor of the anti -fascist coalition. </p>
<p>The victory of Soviet weapons on the Volga was the result of heroic efforts 
 of the entire Soviet people, of their realizations on the military front and 
 economic. This victory raised the moral of Soviet citizens, who 
 They saw that their blood and their work had not been in vain. It gave it 
 new forces to those who continued to languish under the yoke of 
 Fascist invaders. The defeat of the enemy armies on the Volga broke the 
 precious war car forged by the German generals for the attacks of 
 Hitler. </p>
<p>The myth of the invincibility of the German army fell miserably, while 
 The strategic initiative was taken away forever. The historical victory over the 
 Volga allowed the red army to develop a general offensive on 
 large scale and to start the liberation of the Soviet territory from 
 invaders. During the winter campaign German troops not only 
 they lost everything they had reached in the summer of 1942, but were forced 
 to abandon a series of cities and regions, where they had been in the 
 1941. </p>
<p>At some points the front moved west of 600-700 km. A big 
 territory of 480 thousand square kilometers was freed from the invaders. The 
 populations of the regions of Voronež and Stalingrado, of the republics 
 autonomous of Ceceno-English, northern obsessia, Cabardino-Bo-Balcaria e 
 of the Calmucchi, of the territory of Stavropol, of the autonomous regions of the 
 about, of the Caraciai and the Adigheti, of almost the whole territory of 
 Krasnodar, of the regions of Rostov and Kursk, of considerable part of the regions 
 by Vorošilovgrad, Smolensk and Orël regained freedom. </p>
<p>The connections interrupted by the enemy on many railways were restored e 
 along the Volga. During the winter campaign 1942-1943 the attackers 
 Fascists suffered colossal losses. From October 1942 to March 1913 beyond 
 1,300,000 between soldiers and officers were taken by the enemy as strength 
 fighter. Particularly serious losses suffered satellite armies 
 of Germany. The III and the IV Romanian armies, the II Hungarian army, the VIII 
 Italian army had practically ceased to exist. The red army destroyed 
 or he captured enormous quantities of weapons and means of the enemy. But it wasn't 
 Only of human losses and materials suffered by Hitler's Germany and by 
 its allies. The defeats dropped the morality of the army and the 
 population of the countries of the fascist axis. </p>
<p>Fascist rulers were forced to announce a 3 -day mourning for 
 The fallen in Stalingrado. For the first time from the beginning of the war, in 
 days of February 1943, the inhabitants of German cities and villages 
 instead, they felt the marches of victory, the funeral strengthening of the 
 bells of the churches. 
 He also changed the tone of German propaganda, who began to talk about the 
 Difficulty and the crisis of the German army in the East. Among the Germans yes 
 widespread the "disease" that the Germanic command called "influence 
 of the soul ", expressing in skepticism A in the growing distrust in the 
 Final victory. </p>
<p>Propaganda and terrorism could no longer heal this 
 "illness". The defeats in the East shook the entire fascist block. Between the 
 Germany and his allies was created an atmosphere of mutual distrust, yes 
 the dissensions that testified to the crisis that began in the lair intensified 
 of the powers of the axis. Germany's influence was also weakened 
 in neutral countries. Japan, which had to enjoy the fruits of the 
 military successes of the axis troops and that awaited only the moment 
 propitious to attack the Soviet Union, he was forced to give up his own 
 intentions. </p>
<p>The victory of the Red Army on the Volga and the subsequent Soviet offensive 
 they marked the beginning of the radical turning point not only during the great 
 Patriotic war of the Soviet people, but also of the whole second war 
 world. This fact was recognized all over the world. In the diploma 
 sent to the defenders of Stalingrado, President Roosevelt wrote that "there
Turn the war of allied nations against aggression ". </p>
<p>Under the influence of events on the Soviet-German front, it developed 
 With greater force the liberation struggle of the peoples of Europe and Asia 
 against Hitler's tyranny. </p>
<p>Thanks to the victory of the Soviet troops, the conditions were created 
 favorable for a greater commitment of all the forces of the anti- 
 Hitleriana. 
 In autumn 1942 the fascist block lined up on the Soviet-German front the 
 Most of their armed forces- 266 divisions of which 193 Germans. 
 This fact allowed the allies of the Soviet Union to start 
 A victorious offensive in North Africa.</p>

 To defend resources such as tree and water. </p>
<p>The operation of the armed men was by the Soldner Brudern Anastasio

 Canasta and Sergio Canalla "<em> are known and by the government of the Republic 
 as the impression of the _ "cartel of expropriation" </em>, which in 
 various communities of Tehuantepec operated on 1. </p>
<p>The history of violence against the community is obvious- </p>
<pre><code>   I. On July 31, 2022, Sergio and his armed in Rincon Tagolaba penetrated to use a criminal named Luis Lopez Zarate as a lieutenant, who had been rejected by the municipal assembly based on his history.

<p>A lot of noise was made when Luiz Inacio resigned, on the 21st, about 80 
 military personnel who served in the plateau and the then commander of the army, Julius 
 Caesar de Arruda, replacing him with Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva. Some, 
 vertigated by the blind belief in the “stability” of bourgeois democracy and its 
 carcomid institutions in the country and that Yankee imperialism “will not 
 allow a blow, ”they even proclaimed that the effective 
 “Lula administration”, without tutelage of the Armed Forces. Luiz Inácio proclaimed that 
 suspicious of the Armed Forces, who wanted a security office 
 Institutional(GSI)without military equipment and played for the 
 audience that I would not accept military orders assistants(para logo depois,
tê-los), in a staging that would not submit to "military power", to 
 try to restrict the margin of maneuver of generals by isolation in the 
 public opinion. </p>
<p>On the 31st, “surprising” a total of zero people politically more 
 Conscious, Luiz Inacio appointed 122 military personnel to the GSI. Mathematics is 
 Clara- Unlike restricting the presence of milicas and, therefore, their 
 Influence on government, the President of the Republic has expanded them!Continuous act, 
 press reports that the petista has endorsed the army to prevent the PM from 
 Federal District of acting, on the night of January 8, against Camp, in the 
 Army General Headquarters. The episode, which involved maneuvers with tanks by 
 part of the armed force to deter the PM, was approved by Luiz Inacio, 
 Faced with the pressures of the generals. As is well known, this maneuver was made to 
 that active, reserve officers and their families could leave the 
 camping and not being detained. </p>
<p>Why, what does this reveal? That the staging of a strengthened Luiz Inácio, who makes 
 And it happens with the military, it lasted less than a soap bubble, since the 
 Intense force attributed to the government is a chimera, illusion. Opportunists and 
 liberals do not see that the defense of this corrupt bourgeois democracy 
 permissive with all kinds of violence against the people does not move it, 
 Contrary, it causes it revulsion and, above all, distrust and anger. Pretty 
 do not know, but they know very well that in politics the effective strength is the masses, 
 and not the notes of entities and offices, innocuous when they are not supported by 
 material. But they want to believe this and try to deceive the masses to 
 believe in this fantasy. </p>
<p>As the government tries to restrict the coup movement with 
 cabinet and grandiloquent pronouncements on “democracy” - this, 
 unknown to the large masses in your daily life-it only becomes 
 inept, while the real force is growing with the generals(hoje, as tropas e, agora, estão jogando para ganhar as massas, principalmente
a pequena e média burguesias e contando com os evangélicos bolsonaristas no
meio dos pobres). The government tends to capitulation; After all, how it could be 
 other way, if since the 2018 elections have silent on the 
 constant coup pronouncements of the military? Not even a criticism, only 
 appeasement!After all, what can do the government of the reactionary coalition, 
 where the great bourgeois and landlords exercise 
 imperialism? If it had a minimum of decency I would have immediately urged the 
 Pasta to the streets in defense of threatened democratic freedoms!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indigenous people are killed, as in the horrendous and criminal case against 
 the Yanomanis, and the peasants are systematically slaughtered in their just 
 Fight for the land. On the morning of January 28, BOPE police, PM de 
 Rondônia shot in peasants that climbed into a boat to cross a river; 
 the military arrested two young people, dragged them to the wilderness, the 
 tortured, even pulling the tongue of one of them, and then execute them to 
 cold blood. Press monopolies, distinguished politicians and institutions 
 From justice, heroes of the defense of this democracy, are complete silence. This 
 It has nothing to do with your democracy, right? </p>
<p>It must also be said that the exchange of generals in charge of the army, made 
 by Luiz Inácio, absolutely nothing changes the nature of force and, 
 even does not alter your scammer claims, which are unanimous among 
 the high office, whose only important divergence is when, at what time 
 and situation culminating the military coup of state. Just see that the now praised 
 as “Legalist Commander”, Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, was the same 
 considered as a protagonist in the newsroom of <em>tuit</em> intimidatory of villas- 
 Bôas, against the HC of Luiz Inacio, in 2018 - <em>tuit</em> which, confessedly, was 
 Written by the ACFA to intervene in national political life. This is the “General 
 Legalist ”, the supervision of the guarantee of democracy in Brazil for the monopoly 
 press and opportunism. May bad sheets cover them!
the days, looking for <em>timing</em> to intervene, fostering small 
 destabilization using the “green chickens” as a cannon bushing and, therefore, 
 signing new agreements with the government in which it is strengthened in the role of power 
 Moderator; Meanwhile, it seeks to gain support from your northern master and 
 support in public opinion to try to crush the people's survey in 
 instant that it is lodged with its righteous wrath. </p>
<p>To stop the scam in march, it is impossible to count on the aristocracy 
 opportunistic, drunk by decades of convescotes on old palacetes 
 State and expectations of reigning for many others. The minimum consequent to 
 do is to support itself in the masses, mobilizing them for their minimum rights 
 trampled daily, through strikes, land taken, occupation of 
 universities and schools, in a torrent of protests and revolutionary struggles; 
 without a drop of illusion with the democracy of the rich.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/lu172642uy8ea_tmp_615708885fed1fb1.jpg" /><strong>Announcement on the occasion of the death of Comrade</strong> <strong><em>*_</em>*Farhad</strong>_(1957 - 2023)The Central Committee of the C(M)PA with deep sorrow informs all cadres,
members, supporters of the C(M)PA, other Afghan Maoists, and Maoist parties
and organizations in other countries of the world of the news of the death of
Comrade "Farhad", a member of the second regional committee of the C(M)PA,
that passed away due to a heart attack on Friday, January 27, 2023, at the age
of 65.</p>
<p>Comrade "Farhad" was born in 1957 And by tolerating all the sufferings,
hardness and difficulties completed the university with a bachelor's degree in
1980. During his studies, he joined the Shola-e Javid's defenders' group.</p>
<p>Comrade "Farhad" started his struggles against the effete regime of the royal
family in his youth, and after the disgraceful Saur coup of 1357 SH(April
Coup, April 27-28, 1978)and following it on December 1979 with the naked
Invasion of the Russian social-imperialist forces on Afghanistan and their
occupation of the country, He rose up to serious opposition against 7th Saur
coup plotters and continued their political, national-democratic and
revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>Comrade Farhad was chased in 1981 and settled in his hometown which was under
the control of Mujahideen parties and left the country in 1982 and fled to
Iran. during his struggles was in close contact with one of his comrades at
"The Revolutionary Union of Afghanistan Workers" and regularly cooperated with
him.</p>
<p>After the occupation of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, by the imperialist
occupiers led by the occupying US imperialism, he rose up against the
unbridled imperialist occupiers and their puppet regime and began its regular
struggles.</p>
<p>When the process of unification of the communist movement(Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist)started in 2002, supported it, and after the approval of the program
and constitution of the C(M)PA on May 1, 2004, confirmed it and accepted the
membership of the party.</p>
<p>In 2008, he became a member of Regional Committee Number 15, and in 2009, he
took responsibility for the Cultural Committee of Regional Committee Number 15
and advanced this position well since 2011. when the ideological-political
struggle between the C(M)PA and the Revolutionary Communist Party of America(RCP)intensified in 2011, he firmly supported the position of the C(M)PA, and
called the ''Avakian's new syntheses'' humanistic and revisionist and rejected
it.</p>
<p>When the seminar of the party against the post-Marxist-Leninist-Maoist line
proposed in the manifesto and constitution of the Revolutionary Communist
Party of America was held in the region, Comrade Farhad along with other
comrades of the regional committee took responsibility for the security of the
seminar and until the end of the seminar, this duty carried out well.</p>
<p>In 2014, he could not participate in the second congress of the party due to
his illness, but with his message, he fully supported the process of the
second congress of the C(M)PA.</p>
<p>After the successful processing of the second All-party congress, comrade
Farhad became a member of the regional committee number(02). He carried this
responsibility well since 2019. when the issue of the Qatar peace process was
raised in 2019, Comrade Farhad took a decisive and principled stance against
the Taliban at the level of regional number two.</p>
<p>After Comrade Zia's death, he gave the youth fighting morale and always
reminded them that the young generation should fill the empty places of the
old comrades and advised the comrades that new blood should flow in the veins
of the party.</p>
<p>He participated in the first anniversary of Comrade Zia's death, which was
organized at the regional level, and wrote a poem about Comrade Zia under the
title "You're gone and the grass went away from the spring field." which is
included in the Persian part of party's website and publications.</p>
<p>Comrade Farhad was a capable poet, critic, and pundit and a good writer for
the party's publications. He discussed the issues of the day from an
ideological-political point of view in every meeting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, death did not allow this valuable comrade, and was taken from
us at the age of 65 due to a heart attack on Friday, January 27, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Comrades</strong> -</p>
<p>Let's turn the sadness caused by the death of Comrade "Farhad" into a
struggling force and keep his memory as a Maoist revolutionary alive and
lasting.</p>
<p><strong>May his memory be blessed and may his path be bright and red!</strong></p>

<h1>The 'legalism' of the reactionary armed forces and the scammers</h1>

<p>**** If there is a vocation in our Armed Forces - these heralds of the reaction - 
 This is for coup. In what they think are patriarchs of the republic and 
 “Guaranteers” of democracy, they reveal themselves as true bandits robbers 
 of power and reactionary bolt. Being the first distinction given due to 
 having been the “founding act” of this republic a military coup given by this force 
 in 1889 and the last, for its harmful role in the crushing of all movements 
 popular liberators of our history, to highlight the Canudos massacre, 
 always in favor of landowners and the great bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>It is symptomatic that it is regarded as a patron of the Brazilian Army, the 
 Archirrectional Duque de Caxias, Marshal responsible for almost all 
 crimes against popular liberation movements and the infamous war of 
 Paraguay, the latter with the concent 
 D. Pedro II. </p>
<p>In a recent fact, the replacement made by Luiz Inacio in charge of the Army, 
 Replacing General Júlio César Arruda with General Tomás Miguel Mine 
 Ribeiro, was seen by many as the exchange of a scammer for a "legalist". 
 In fact, it is the exchange of one scammer for another, but less 
 Bake. Complete illusion or bad faith of whom this change this change 
 could stop the coup march or even change the coup nature of FA's 
 reactionary. And the reason for this being like this has its deep roots in history 
 of Brazil and, in particular, of these armed forces, in such luck 
 a crime who, in doing politics, ignores them and an even greater who pretends 
 unaware of them. </p>
<p>The first fact, already constant in the brief introduction of this text, reflects such 
 nature of FA's and define their performance within the so -called 
 Republic to this day, that is, that once “founders” of the said 
 Republic(burocrático-latifundiária)if they find their legitimate owners and in 
 right to dictate your directions ultimately, in the “serious moments” why 
 It crosses-whenever the revolution knocks on the door. Deodoro da 
 Fonseca, Marshal 'Leal' to the emperor, a monarchist assumed, is the one who leads the 
 coup that ends the imperial regime. In the evaluation of some srs. liberals and 
 of opportunists on duty, it would therefore be a “legalist”, enthusiast of 
 democratic order and not a coup, in the service of imperialism, especially 
 English, whose contradictions with the decaying Empire of Brazil jumped to the new 
 quality, demanding reactionary exit, in addition to the need to restore the 
 buzz and division within the army's own ranks, among officers 
 of low patent and the General, the so -called “military issue”. </p>
<p>Thus succeeded by five military blows, in which, when confronting wings 
 of the reactionary armed forces, particularly of his army, about which 
 form should be dictated the directions of the country, an era always seen as legalistic 
 or democratic, creating the illusion that these who have always exercised power 
 bayonets against the nation and the Brazilian people would have to submit to 
 popular will. Of common, the self -employed role of “guaranteers”, always 
 interpreted by military hosts as a safe conduct for an intervention, 
 when they deem necessary. </p>
<p>In 1954, on August 24, Getúlio Vargas committed committed to the intention of determining 
 The new scammer march about his government. However, year and a half later, already in 
 1955, military personnel again pronounce against the result of the 
 that year's elections, which elected Juscelino Kubitschek and João Goulart and the 
 preach a blow against the president -elect. A fact occurs, then, that comes to 
 reinforce the illusion of a “democratic wing” or “tradition 
 legalist ”of the Brazilian Army, in the episode known as the“ Novembrada de 
 55 ”, involving the then Marshal Lott. A preventive blow is set in march 
 by the then Minister of War, Marshal Lott, depriving the president in 
 exercise and preventing the president of law, who would be the deputy of Vargas, 
 dead. This movement, like others in our history, if in appearance 
 guaranteed the legality of the process, in essence reinforced the role of 
 tutors of Brazilian democracy. So much is true that 9 years later, if 
 consume direct military intervention, after threats and blackmail 
 About the three presidents elected in the period- Juscelino Kubitschek, Jânio 
 Tables and João Goulart. Or, if not, the same Marshal Eurico Gaspar Dutra, 
 “Guaranteer” of the “New Republic” in the repression of the 1932 Paulista Intent, 
 Therefore, the same carnage of the repression of the popular uprising of 1935, and repressor 
 of the fascist intent in 1936 and, soon, a coup in 1937 with Vargas in the state 
 New and, finally, raised to the presidency in the coup suffocated at the polls1 in 
 1945, testifying Vargas himself to whom he had threatened a blow since years earlier. </p>
<p>Advancing to recent history, after the dark civil-military regime 
 fascist and the scandalous unrestricted amnesty of the torturers, we have seen
issue a value judgment on the directions of the homeland, with its nefaning “ 
 Nation ”, threatening the bureaucratic-latifight institutions and their consort 
 “Democratic Rule of Law” and enjoying its motto of “legitimacy, 
 legality and stability ”, which translates into the legitimacy of which 
 inalienable holders by owners who find themselves from the political regime, in the 
 legality that they choose to defend it, always consecrated with a 
 Constitution to support it and the stability of cemetery peace, obtained in the 
 more fierce repression to any force that opposes. Such a general was, also 
 he, appointed by a government of the petista opportunism and considered by social liberals 
 as “Democrat”(alguns mais emocionados a chamá-lo de “meu general”), one 
 instead convinced of the need for a turnaround, he acted alongside Temer to 
 Dilma's impediment and today is a wiped -off voice, following the 
 scratches the true "tradition" of this institution. </p>
<p>General Hamilton Mourão, now back to his characteristic outfit of 
 coup out of the catacombs of the most obtuse reactionary, it was considered 
 as “progressive” or “legalist” by some stoops and scoundrels while 
 vice-president, when polarizing with the moral delinquency and rot 
 Bolsonaro. The same Mourão who celebrated the massacre against the popular uprising 
 1935, on the date of its 87 years, and which openly preached the military coup in a 
 Lecture in 2015. </p>
<p>Once again the mirage, from a legalistic general, now with Tomás 
 Ribeiro. But if history does not serve as a warning, we take your own 
 words, in a speech given at the headquarters of the Military Command of the 
 Southeast in January. After a scene game and stroke to the press monopolies and 
 alerts to the far right against the division within the force, so 
 that weighs whirlwind, earthquakes, tsunamis, we will continue to rush, cohesive, 
 respectful, _ <em> <strong> guaranteeing </strong> _ ___ <strong> our democracy </strong> _ </em> ”(grifo nosso). 
 To conclude by discussing his judgment of what democracy is and how “protected 
 there"_. </p>
<p>Still in late January, reporters of the press monopoly, report that the 
 Even General Tomás elaborated in conjunction with villas-bôas the infamous tweet in 
 threat to the Supreme Court. He would have included the "repudiation of impunity." 
 Again, there would be those souls that would say that is proof of their fairness, 
 forgetting the fact that it did not oppose to discuss, much less 
 Publish, such a derision. </p>
<p>This podium has always been alerted from the historical and gross error of taking in the 
 dispute between right and extreme right within FA's and within the 
 dominant classes, an opposition between a democratic wing tells a scammer, 
 fascism versus democracy or even a legalist and professional wing against 
 an interventionist and subversive. It is a reactionary dispute. </p>
<p>At the end and to the cable, we left 2022 and entered in 1960, which indicates maneuvers 
 risky president -elect to fulfill his mandate and that possibly 
 we will pass again by 1964, but in other circumstances radically 
 different, pointing to the direct confrontation of coup marching to the 
 fascism and the revolutionary mass movement pointing to the way 
 prolonged of the democratic revolution. And this time, there will be no amnesty. </p>
<p>1st note, the then “New Republic” had able to vote in 1945, only 
 6 million Brazilians. By way of comparison, in the US, they already voted 50 
 millions. </p>

 is close to the one -year anniversary of the beginning of the war and 
 It is also rumored that Blinken will visit the country. The proposed 
 Mobilization concerns us so much the complaint of the unjust war that 
 raging, of the imperialists starring in the slaughter, of the local ruler 
 class that turns the country into a base for its American bosses 
 and involves the people on this basis in its reactionary confrontation with 
 Turkish bourgeoisie as well as the racing condemnation of his arrival 
 Representative of American imperialism. From this content derives 
 and the path of demonstration we believe should be followed, 
 Opposite to both embassies, American and Russian. </p>
<p>On the side of NAP, the CMA and the match, with the special views 
 Of course of each organization, there was a general agreement on its content 
 Proposal. However, disagreements were expressed - from different starting points - in relation to 
 with the proposed route of the demonstration. NAP and CMA, participating 
 together in anti -war initiative, they proposed the realization 
 separate concentration at two embassies on a different date than 
 Blinken visit. </p>
<p>In the placements of the rest of the forces, indifference to the 
 Need to terminate war and an attempt to separate it from 
 Blinken Visit, with exclusive focus on the answer to 
 Give the movement to it. Fact which did not cause us special 
 impression, as the views of a series of organizations on the 
 Issue, moving from the - deprived - acquittal of Russian imperialism 
 up to the overt acceptance of the subjugation of peoples' interests to 
 His choices, in the name of anti -Americanism and anti -fascism. To 
 The following confrontation emerged were the obstacles set by such 
 placements in the organization of anti -war mobilization, with the reluctance of 
 This is openly confessed by both Ara and Lad. From 
 the side of the ARA the only reference proposed in relation to the war was the 
 One -sided complaint of the expansion of NATO, western sanctions and the 
 Model for "peaceful settlement" of the conflict. </p>
<p>Given the inability to end in an agreement, the appointment was renewed 
 by setting a new meeting for Friday 3/2. In spite of the intense 
 Disagreements between political forces, on our part, insist on 
 attempt to find commonplace for the realization of anti-imperialist- 
 anti -war mobilization, utilizing the moods expressed for the 
 Conducting a course against the challenge of visiting the representative of 
 America in the country. As part of this effort, we declare the 
 our mood to seek compromises and modify items of 
 of our proposal, but without having the intent at the content level of 
 We do behind the essence of the slogan “Peoples do not need from 
 patrons' and leave one of his arsonists untouched 
 War and the murderers of the peoples.</p>

<p>Faculty of letters occupied against life imprisonment and 41 bis </p>
<p>For Alfredo Libero!</p>
<p>Change Rome </p>
<p>As students and students of Sapienza, in the city assembly today, 
 We have collectively decided to occupy the faculty of letters in 
 Solidarity in Alfredo Cossed, against impedimental life sentence and 41 bis. </p>
<p>At 106 days of hunger strike by Alfredo Cossuto we think it is important 
 Take a speaker on the problematicity of the prison system. From the murder of 
 13 inmates during the prison revolts of March 2020, to the beatings suffered 
 In the cells in the following months, the state confirms the use of torture tools 
 like the 41 bis and the purely reluctant imperative life imprisonment to punish dissent 
 in our country. </p>
<p>Outside you try to criminalize solidarity and social struggles. Forces 
 of the Order and the State are premier to make raids in the trade union offices, in the 
 social centers, to chase and stop students and students on the streets 
 of the Center, to militarize an entire city for the "anarchist danger", 
 building a climate of terror. The "terrorists" who took to the streets in the last 
 Days are Studentə, WORKITRICRIR, unemployment. </p>
<p>We also decided to give an answer from the University. It is recently 
 become increasingly clear how much this is a place of commodification of the 
 Knowing, of blackmail and competition. Especially here is fundamental 
 have a chance to confront and start thinking together 
 Alternatives to the drama of the present and the inexistence of the future. </p>
<p>It does not exist and we do not ask for a "negotiation between state and anarchists" but 
 the abolition of institutionalized torture. </p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/helseminister-kjerkol-1160x758.jpg" /><em> Image- Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol.</em> </p>
<hr />
<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media. </p>
<hr />
<p><em>This is a debate article. Analysis and standpoint are the writer's own.</em> </p>
<p><strong> The entire Norwegian health care system is in a state of increasing decay. The 
 , among other things, appear in massive cuts over the last forty years, and in the 
 Last shocking spreads of caring elderly people who do not get food. </strong> </p>
<p>Lately, more focus has been placed on the crisis in the Norwegian health care system, 
 Especially in connection with NRK's documentary that has uncovered major deficiencies in 
 Elderly care. This is part of an extensive deterioration that has taken place 
 for decades and the Minister of Health has just announced that it will come 
 Even more cuts, as a result of animal times. </p>
<h4><strong> Unworthy elderly care and halving hospital beds </strong></h4>
<p>The debate rages in several places after the Brennpunkt documentary showed that 
 Nursing elderly people did not get food, do not go to the bathroom, must lie down at 17 
 or in other ways not treated with any dignity. Employees in the elderly care 
 have crying stood forward and notified that they do not have the time or effort to 
 Provide proper care. It is referred to as a staffing crisis in elderly care. 
 The stories have raised rage and despair, and at the same time the politicians cannot 
 Love any concrete or significant to solve the problem. It is 
 revealed that very many elderly and nursing people need nursing home, 
 Don't get it. And it has been revealed that many of those who receive follow -up at home get 
 Very deficient like that. </p>
<p>For example, NRK writes that almost half of the residents of nursing homes eat 
 Too little according to new figures from the Directorate of Health and that this problem has increased 
 In recent years. </p>
<p>Several doctors, including the famous Red-member Mads Gilbert, have declared 
 That there is a crisis in the health care system. He writes about personnel shortages, 
 Overload and sick leave. And he writes about the cuts completed 
 earlier- </p>
<p>"The situation is in despair. While the number of patients is increasing is constantly decreasing 
 The number of beds - both in somatic and psychiatric hospitals. We have too few 
 Beds, too high coating, for short bedtime and too high pressure on staff(…)The number of Norwegian hospital beds is actually halved last 40 years- </p>
<p>1980- 22,000 hospital beds in Norway </p>
<p>2019- 11,000 beds, and 1.3 million more inhabitants </p>
<p>In 2019, the year before the pandemic, we had 100,000 more patients in Norwegian hospitals, 
 at the same time 600 fewer beds than in 2015(SSB 2020)" </p>
<p>We repeat- The number of hospital beds has been halved over the last 40 years!This in one 
 situation where the number of elderly, and thus old age diseases, constantly increases, and 
 Where the population has also increased significantly. And we can add that the Norwegian 
 The state during the same period has become a lot richer. Gross national product(BNP)has more than doubled since 1980. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/tWFduO6UJ8lOv1QnaHEAjiuWzlIdHM8DqIhbS5jvUJS-Pc_oGAJVffUCQOzexQ9zJ-DFudZG-R1H9ajIHZe5T-k-OJ2aSyXFG01h0h_yPoFCJ4rnTEm4eGi8OkyYHBcTyTwLRwhoSqFozXOYukf4qbs" />#### <strong> Crisis in the air ambulance, the district hospitals, the food supply, the health homes, 
 Psychiatry and the GP arrangement </strong> </p>
<p>Mads Gilbert has also recently stated in several media about new air ambulance crisis 
 And about the hospital crisis in Northern Norway. After the private company Babcock 
 Taken over the operation of the air ambulances, the preparedness has been severely weakened. IN 
 Northern Norway needs hospitals to cut more in the services. Gilbert says he 
 Fears a sharp slaughter knife on an already vulnerable hospital offering throughout 
 The region. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a popular protest is developed by the organization 
 Maternity uprising, which fights against the reduced offer to pregnant and birth 
 Women. The City of Oslo has just laid down the ABC clinic, to great protests 
 From both employees and so -called users. All over the country it has been cut in 
 The food supply. Some must travel for several hours to follow up the midwife or 
 for acute help. </p>
<p>For Oslo's part, the so -called health care crisis is developed, after disclosures and 
 Protests in connection with inadequate care of these. Here too it has come 
 Forward heartbreaking stories from patients and relatives. Here too is the core 
 of the problem that there is too little personnel at work, and too little capacity and 
 Economics to give people decent welfare. </p>
<p>In recent years there has been a lot of focus on increasing reported psychological 
 disorders. In connection with several murder cases and situations in which the police have 
 shot and killed people, the index finger has been directed at poor psychiatric 
 Follow -up. It is often written that youth report increased anxiety and 
 depression. Does this mean that psychiatry has been equipped? By no means!42 
 Percentage of the psychiatric 24 -hour beds in Norway has been removed in 23 years. The 
 Last four decades have 60 percent of the daily places in Finland, Sweden and 
 Denmark disappeared. So the psychiatry of cuts is also affected and this is a 
 Development that has been going on for decades. </p>
<p>Thus, a fairly clear picture of a health care system in crisis over
country". There is a crisis in the elderly care, the food supply, the health homes, the psychiatry, 
 District hospitals and a general crisis in hospitals. And we haven't mentioned 
 the so -called GP, which makes a number of people across the country 
 The GP does not receive the law by law. We haven't mentioned either 
 the dispute over the new hospital to be built in Oslo, or that it is long 
 health queues to the public hospitals, and more and more private companies such as 
 Profits on illness and cuts in the public sector. </p>
<h4><strong> Critical lack of money and personnel </strong></h4>
<p>In the midst of this critical situation, Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol has notified 
 That there will be new cuts in the health care system as a result of price growth across the board. 
 Government will meet increased inflation and higher interest rates with more cuts in public 
 Welfare. Thus it is crystal clear that politicians will not improve 
 The condition of the health care system, on the contrary!It is beyond any doubt that 
 The situation will get worse. All the problems uncovered can be boiled down to 
 resource and personnel shortages, and at the same time a tighter budgets are notified as 
 Will create more such deficiency. There are bluff and explanations to claim that new 
 norms or rules or "efficiency" can remedy the critical deficiency 
 on personnel and funding. </p>
<p>Mads Gilbert writes “The pandemic that symptoms reveals the basic 
 The disease in Norwegian hospitals - and in the municipalities- under -budgeting, closures 
 and starving the sector for the last two decades. There is a wild policy 
 that has led here "and" in 2001 Lyn-introduced Ap with excited support from H and 
 Frp an enterprise reform that took Norwegian public hospitals out of the administration 
 To consciously convert them into large 'business group', or shop ". </p>
<p>KrF leader Olaug Bollestad calls the situation dramatically and asks where 
 The Minister of Health believes the health care system should cut now. Bollestad fights one 
 Desperate struggle for the party's survival in national politics but has been sitting in 
 Governments that are responsible for this development themselves. </p>
<p>Is Gilbert right that this is a wild policy? How is it possible that 
 The health care system in one of the world's richest and most stable countries is in a state 
 of generally decay? </p>
<h4><strong> Health crisis is part of the general crisis in imperialism </strong></h4>
<p>Gilbert is only partially right. It is correct that the crisis is developing as a result of 
 Cuts and market adaptation, adopted by the politicians. But these operate within 
 A larger economic and political context, where their choices are 
 limited. The Norwegian imperialist state operates within an imperialism 
 In general crisis. Imperialism is capitalism in decay, it is rotting and 
 Dying capitalism. Within the economy we see how the crises have constantly become 
 deeper since the 1970s. Karl Marx demonstrated a tendency for the profit rate 
 decreases, which simply means that capitalists have to constantly invest more for 
 to increase profits. This is expressed in declining growth rates throughout Europe, 
 Throughout the past decades, from its peak in the decade right after others 
 World War. </p>
<p>Under some misleading words such as "neoliberalism" and "privatization," led 
 the oil crises in the 1970s to a new policy across Europe, to 
 Market -passing public sector with two goals- first to cut spending 
 to welfare and second to increase revenues for capitalists. These two 
 The dimensions are two sides of the same coin. It can be said even simpler- the goal is to 
 transfer values tied up in welfare to the monopoly capital so that these can 
 Invest to increase profits. </p>
<p>To call this "privatization" is misleading because the public sector is constantly increasing 
 its share of Norwegian GDP, and so it is in many countries. The trend is more 
 State monopoly capitalism, no less. But this trend goes hand in hand with 
 market adaptation, market mechanisms in the public sector, and one 
 "Efficiency" aimed at cutting expenses, not improve 
 Welfare services. </p>
<p>The point is that if the authorities chose differently, the public sector had to become a 
 "Money extinguisher" that increased the state's expenses and decreased or completely ranked 
 away the profits, not only in the state but in the companies that have to join 
 The splice layer. This would weaken Norwegian imperialism in the competition at 
 the world market, and it would all increase the upcoming financial problems. 
 The government states today that what is on the agenda is cut, not 
 large -scale focus on improvements. If one thinks this is just about 
 ideological delusions and neoliberal prejudices in politicians, then one takes 
 Enough wrong. It is to some extent true that they take into account financial and 
 Political realities. There is even a social and demographic reality that 
 playing in, namely declining birth rates among Norwegian women and increasing proportion 
 Elderly and nursing. There is no evidence that this development should turn around 
 Heller, and with the closure of birth offerings, the trend would probably rather 
 worsen. </p>
<p>It is all a question of what economic system prevails in Norway and the world
is the tendency to decay in imperialism, which now comes ever clearer 
 expressed in the health care system. </p>
<p>The enormous paradox in this system is how wealth comes from poverty. 
 It is only by understanding that this is a built -in paradox in imperialism, one 
 inherent contradiction, that one can understand how Norway can double its GDP and in 
 The same period must halve the number of hospital beds. The increasing wealth that is gathered 
 On a few hands, comes directly or indirectly from the poverty of others. 
 Poverty in the Norwegian public sector, goes hand in hand with the public sector 
 Increases their share of GDP and Norwegian companies are becoming increasingly richer. It is a 
 GRELT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS System is illogical and unfair, and 
 For the long time, belongs to the scrap heap of history. </p>

<h4><strong> The fight for health care and for people's rights </strong></h4>
<p>It opens even more, with certain necessity, a sharpened class struggle in 
 connection with the Norwegian health care system. On the one hand the struggle for the people's 
 Rights in general, the fight against cuts and for a dignified health system, on it 
 the other side of the struggle for the workers' and the vocational graduates pay and working conditions 
 special. These are two important matches, where we have seen many protests and 
 Strikes in recent decades and will only be more important in the years to come. </p>
<p>We will first get the complete solution to the problem in socialism. It 
 the subordinate treatment of everything from birth women to sick elderly should be a 
 strong motivation to throw themselves into the struggle to create a strong 
 Revolutionary movement in Norway. </p>

 Time, the community can't stand it anymore, right? Live distressed, has no 
 More joy to work in the fields, right. Women, our wives, also 
 They worry about us, right. Children and young people are growing and seeing 
 that one". </p>

<p><strong> Indigenous defend themselves from landlord crimes </strong> </p>
<p>The Maranhense Amazon Forest Region is the scene of an intense conflict 
 agrarian involving land grabbers, mining companies, large loggers and 
 prospective(todos financiados e organizados por grandes latifundiários)and the 
 Guajajara, Awá-Guajá and Kaapor peoples. In order to protect your lands from 
 invaders, the indigenous people conform in 2007 a group of self -defense entitled 
 “Forest Guardians”. At that time, a truck used to explore 
 Illegal wood in the woods of the region was seized by the indigenous people. </p>
<p>According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office(MPF), the vehicle belonged to the timber 
 Geraldo Cândido da Costa Filho, known as “Geraldinho”. In vain 
 attempted to bribe the indigenous people, was offered $ 15,000 for 
 indigenous people return the truck. Given the refusal, a group of loggers 
 Strongly armed with large -caliber weapons attacked the village. During the 
 Conflict, Cacique Tomé Guajajara exchanged fire with the invaders. At end, 
 The gunslinger Josevan da Costa Gomes died and Cacique himself, and two 
 severely injured indigenous people. “Geraldinho” and the brothers Joane and Elias Rodrigues 
 da Costa were denounced by the MPF for the murder of Tomé Guajajara, but, 
 once again proving to be an instrument of landlords and large 
 Bourgeois, the old Brazilian state did not apply the sentence. </p>
<p>In 2021, given the increase in invasions and violence against indigenous peoples, 
 the group performed through a letter entitled “If our land, our 
 Forest disappears, what will be from my people? ” several complaints about the old 
 State, invasions of loggers, death threats and murders. In the letter, the 
 Guardians claim that the actions undertaken by the group have fought the action of 
 illegal loggers and other invaders. “We identified the invaders, 
 we destroy their camps and expel them from our land, ”they say in the 
 text. The group also emphasizes the connection between the landlord and the old state 
 with the great propaganda of the so -called “agribusiness” to the detriment of the right to 
 Earth. “The government only talks about Agro- Agro is it, agro is that, agro is 
 Development, agro is everything to them. For us not. For the government, the 
 Wealth is soy, it's cane, it's ox. White thinks like this, but we don't. Money 
 For us not to buy anyone's life, ”he says. The indigenous people conclude the letter 
 reaffirming the commitment and independence of your struggle- “We will continue

<p>There was a lot of noise when Luiz Inacio dismissed, on the 21st, about 80 military 
 that served in the Planalto and the then army commander, Júlio César 
 of Arruda, replacing it with Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva. Some stunned 
 before the blind belief in the "stability" of bourgeois democracy and its 
 eating institutions in the country and that Yankee imperialism "will not allow 
 A coup d'etat "came to proclaim that the cash" Government of Lula " 
 It had been inaugurated there, without protection of the Armed Forces. Luiz Inacio 
 proclaimed that he distrusted the armed forces, that he wanted an office of 
 Institutional Security(GSI)No military equipment and played with the public to 
 that he would not accept military orders assistants(y poco después, tenerlos), 
 In a staging that he would not undergo "military power", to treat 
 to restrict the maneuvering margin of the generals through isolation 
 of public opinion. </p>
<p>On the 31st, "surprising" a total of zero people with conscience 
 Politics, Luiz Inacio appointed 122 soldiers for the GSI. Mathematics is 
 Clara- instead of restricting the presence of militias and, therefore, their 
 Influence in the Government, the President of the Republic increased them!
 Immediately, the press reported that the PT gave the army endorsement to 
 prevent the Federal District PM will act, the night of January 8, 
 Against the camp, in the Army Headquarters. The episode, which 
 involved maneuvers with armed force tanks to deter PM, it was 
 Approved by Luiz Inacio, given the pressure of the generals. As is known, this 
 maneuver was carried out so that active and reserve officers and their families 
 They could leave the camp and not be arrested. </p>
<p>Now what does that reveal? That the staging of a strengthened Luiz Inacio, 
 What happens and passes with the military, lasted less than a soap pomp, since 
 The supposed force attributed to the government is a chimera, an illusion. The 
 opportunistic and liberals do not exaggerate that the defense of this democracy 
 corrupt and permissive bourgeois with all kinds of violence against the people do not 
 It moves them, on the contrary, it causes disgust and, above all, 
 distrust and anger. They pretend not to know, but they know very well that in politics the 
 Effective force are the masses, and not the notes of entities and charges, harmless 
 When they have no material support. But they want to believe this and try to deceive 
 The masses also create this fantasy. </p>
<p>While the government tries to restrict the coup movement with agreements of 
 Cabinet and grandiloquent pronouncements on "democracy" -which, 
 unknown to the wide masses in their daily lives-, it only becomes 
 inept, while true force is increasingly in 
 General( hoy, las tropas y, ahora, están jugando a ganar a las masas,
principalmente a la pequeña y mediana burguesía y apoyándose en los
evangélicos bolsonaristas entre los pobres). The government tends to 
 capitulation; After all, how could it not be otherwise, if from 
 The 2018 elections are silent in front of the constants 
 Military coup pronouncements? Not a single criticism, only 
 appeasement!After all, what can the coalition government do 
 reactionary, where the great bourgeoisie and landowners exercise power 
 servants of imperialism? If I had a minimum of decency, immediately 
 I would have called the masses to the streets in defense of freedoms 
 democratic threatened!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, indigenous people are killed, as in the horrendous and criminal case 
 against the Yanomami, and the peasants are systematically killed in their 
 fair struggle for earth. On the morning of January 28, Bope Police, from 
 The Rondônia Military Police shot at peasants who climbed into a 
 boat to cross a river; The military arrested two young people, the 
 They dragged a separated place, they were tortured, they even started the 
 Language to one of them, and then executed them in cold blood. The monopolies of 
 the press, the illustrious political and the institutions of justice, heroes of 
 The defense of this democracy, silent completely. This has nothing to do 
 With his democracy, right? </p>
<p>It must also be said that the change of generals under the army, 
 Made by Luiz Inacio, nothing changes in the nature of force and neither 
 He even changes his coup intentions, which are unanimity among the high
Situation culminates the military coup. Just see that the now praised like 
 "Legalist commander", Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, was the same considered 
 protagonist in the writing of the intimidating tweet of Villas-Bôas, against the 
 HC of Luiz Inacio, in 2018 - a tweet that, by the way, was written by the ACFA 
 to intervene in national political life. This is the "legalistic general", 
 maximum guarantee of democracy in Brazil for the monopoly of the press and the 
 opportunism. What a bad sheets cover them!</p>
<p>The ACFA is calculating and reformulating its intervention plans every day 
 military, looking for the right time to intervene, promoting small 
 destabilizations using "green chickens" as cannon meat and, 
 Soon, signing new agreements with the government in which it comes out 
 reinforced on paper. of moderating power; Meanwhile, seek to win the 
 support from his master in the north and the support of public opinion to try 
 Crush the lifting of the town at the time they lift themselves with their 
 fair anger. </p>
<p>To stop the coup running it is impossible to have the aristocracy 
 opportunistic, drunk for decades of cocktails in palaces of the old state and 
 expectations of reigning for many more. The minimum is to rely on 
 the masses, mobilizing them for their minimum trampled rights day by day, to 
 through strikes, land shots, occupation of universities and schools, in 
 a torrent of revolutionary protests and struggles; Without a drop of illusion with 
 The democracy of the rich.</p>

<h1>What will the Lula government do with the Federal Hospitals Network? (By Maria de Fátima Siliansky de Andreazzi*)</h1>
<p>Author- Maria de Fátima Siliansky de Andreazzi</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/17466_B7A354DB3642C786-7.jpg" />Federal hospitals are targets of dismantling in successive governments. Photo- CNN </p>
<p>Government transition programs, much more than projects 
 electoral/electorals, indicate more specifically what is expected of the new 
 management. Ministry of Health hospitals are a huge and quite 
 significant, made up of general hospitals and specialized institutes(os
do Câncer, Traumato-Ortopedia, Cardiologia)scattered mainly in 
 city of Rio de Janeiro and serving the entire state. The six general hospitals 
 of the network have more than 1,600 beds outside the deactivated [1]- hospital 
 FEDERAL OF WALK(HFA), Federal hospital of Bonsucesso(HFB), Hospital 
 Federal Cardoso Fontes(HFCF), Federal Hospital of Ipanema(HFI), Hospital 
 Federal of the lagoon(HFL), Federal Hospital of State Servants(HFSE). THE 
 Costing of all these units reaches R $ 2.2 billion per year. </p>
<p>For lack of personnel, they do not work with the maximum capacity necessary for 
 support hospitalization needs- sometimes up to 40 percent of their 
 beds are closed and the lack of personnel has been partially covered with 
 temporary contracts that generate immense insecurity in the continuity of 
 services, being insufficient to cover the need. Every end of these 
 contracts, around 2,000 to 4,000 jobs, generates the foreshadowing of 
 chaos and closure of these hospitals. It is paid out to be outsourced services that, 
 Otherwise, they could save money to be made by the personnel. </p>
<p>The Bolsonaro government continued and deepened this dismantling of hospitals 
 federal, which was very sharp due to the covid pandemic, but the 
 Crisis comes from long before. The last contest for federal hospitals in Rio 
 January was held in 2005 and the approved candidates were only 
 called in 2009 by court decision demanded by themselves, since the 
 Caducaria contest. Without regular replacement, there was a deficit of 8,243 
 servants, according to the Public Defender's Office of the Union(DPU), that in 2020 does not 
 resolved. </p>
<p>Why the governments Dilma, Temer and Bolsonaro did not contest for the 
 hospitals, which would be known to generate stability and allow activation 
 of the deactivated beds? What solution is the government's transition program 
 Lula pointed to solve this very serious issue(decorrente da qual uma
fila para cirurgia ortopédica pode demorar 3 anos ou uma colonoscopia 1 ano a
despeito do esforço que os servidores públicos fazem para manter serviços
funcionando a duras penas)? Services such as transplant services to 
 Pay the same service in private initiative. </p>
<p>In the Health Transition Program, which was attended by the current 
 Minister, Nísia Trindade, in identifying the problems of the network 
 specialized, the reduction of care and shortages, 
 But there is no line related to the lack of personnel. Therefore, this is not a 
 problem for the government that enters. </p>
<p>At the same time, as priority actions, it proposes- to ensure access and reduce 
 queues for consultations, examinations, surgeries and specialized procedures, 
 immediate start. Where and who will do these procedures? The private network? Per 
 Is this not investing in public hospitals? At the same time, the 
 budget reduction and recomposition of R $ 10.47 billion for the 
 year 2023 and an increase of R $ 12.3 billion to meet increased demand. Or 
 that is, the concern with resources is accurate, but where will the money go? 
 To face the obstacles of the specialized network(os hospitais)proposes 
 calls for a national effort to face the queues of consultations, exams and 
 existing surgeries in each region of the country and qualify Sisreg. </p>
<p>But specifically for federal hospitals, the 
 project- </p>
<p>1. <em>Second the TCU [2] would be valid to evaluate the possibility of the source of 
 resources for the unit, consider factors as a value delivery level 
 for the population.</em> - Under this language out of business MBAs, it 
 proposes to compensate hospitals for the results(e resultados em saúde é muito
mais complexo do que num supermercado)but does not commit to resources 
 So that they can perform better and the main one is personal. </p>
<p>two. _ Evaluation of the hospital's performance by the governance structure, 
 directing care actions to user satisfaction_ - here a 
 Dark language that only lights an alert of what's coming. </p>
<p>3 . <em>Reavalize the management model of the RJ hospitals network linked to the 
 Ms</em>. Here is the key to understanding the project that we will comment on, 
 that is, why the transition program does not commit to the replacement of the 
 personal through contest. </p>
<p>4 . <em>Cupação of management positions without observing technical criteria</em>. 
 Again, maybe business MBAs make a difference. </p>
<p>Just don't understand who doesn't want to understand- that the PT government project,
strengthen the public character, the public tender and the server in the area of 
 health. The government's alignment with the neoliberal discourse that accuses the server 
 public of inoperation meets the need to make the expense 
 public, proper to the adjustment policies, that is, to facilitate the dismissal of 
 workers and reduce services. Local mandonism, coronelismo and all 
 forms of personal domination that characterize our society point to 
 also flexible management models for nepotism, clientele formation 
 and corruption as social organizations. In the case of foundation models and 
 public company, the path is to become mixed companies that can 
 meet both SUS and health plans. The origin of this whole policy is 
 the submission to imperialism is the proposals of the World Bank for 
 public hospitals, through private public partnerships, which seem to be 
 accepted in a good way and not as bitter medicines, for those who have already defended one day 
 an electoral way for socialism in contrast to the revolutionary movement 
 of the late 70's and early 80's. </p>
<p>The combative servants of the Ministry of Health who prepare. Ebserh is 
 example of harassment to servers, business model of goals and environment of 
 work that plays workers of different bonds against each other 
 For better control. Promises a lot and delivers little, contracts are not 
 Fulfilled, there is a reduction in service and closure of services. Herself 
 may become the manager of federal hospitals, as leaked for the 
 Press in December. </p>
<p>Very confetti brings the transition program on the councils with participation 
 of social movements, closed or boycotted by the Bolsonaro government. But, in 
 past, in the creation of EBSERH, the Dilma government respected the opposite of the 
 National Health Council? </p>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Our comrades in communist international(ci-ic.org)has published one 
 Article on the historical victory the Red Army won over Hitler fascism in 
 1943. Stalingrad was a turning point not only in the war but in humanity's 
 history.</strong> </p>
<p>The comrades write that the International Communist Association has taken chairman 
 Mao's position- comrade Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, who defined 
 Leninism and played a crucial role in World War II, especially on the basis 
 of the 7th congress in the Communist International. The comrades look 
 The article in connection with this position. </p>
<p>They write that chairman Mao has defined the battle of Stalingrad as not only 
 the turning point of the war between the Soviet Union and Germany, or in it 
 Anti -fascist world war, but a turning point in human history. </p>
<p>The Soviet Union, under the great leadership of comrade Stalin, led a 
 fair war, a large -scale and heroic defense, which used the burnt 
 Earth's tactics and won over the Hitler fascism at a price of 25 million 
 Soviet life. This great war was also important to inspire and generate 
 fair liberation wars in the colonies throughout the Third World. </p>
<p>German Wehrmacht attacked Stalingrad to take over the city on August 23, 1942. An aspect 
 By the importance of the city, it was the name of Stalin. In an order from mate 
 Stalin he demanded greater efforts and sacrifice from the Red Army. In this 
 The order says comrade Stalin among other things- </p>
<p>«Each commander, soldier in the Red Army and Political Commissioner must understand that 
 Our means are not unlimited. The territory of the Soviet State is not a desert, 
 But people - workers, farmers, intelligence, our fathers, mothers, wives, 
 Brothers, children. The territory of the Soviet Union that the enemy has conquered or 
 Want to conquer are bread and other products for the army, metal and fuel for 
 industry, factories, works that supply the army with weapons and ammunition, 
 Railways.(…)Further retreat means to waste ourselves away and at the same time 
 Sacrifice our motherland.(…)If we do not stop the retreat we will be without bread, 
 without fuel, without metal, without raw materials, without factories and works, without 
 Railways. This leads to a conclusion, it is time to stop the retreat. 
 Not one step back!"(Vår egen oversettelse.)Comrade Stalin declared that retreat was to be considered a betrayal. The population in 
 Stalingrad was incorporated into the armed resistance to Wehrmacht. The fascist 
 6. Army took the city but through Operation Uranus under the leadership of Georgij 
 Zjukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky, were organized troops north and west of 
 city. The Red Army surrounded Stalingrad, which caught nearly 300,000 
 enemy forces there and cut their supply lines, and then tighten the grip 
 more and more. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the battle of Stalingrad shows that in war is that 
 People, not weapons, which are the most important. The battle not only evolved from 
 street to street and house to house but from room to room and it was written heroic 
 Chapters in human history that shook the world. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the fascist offensive against the Soviet Union led by 
 the Nazis and with the support of fascists from Italy, Spain, Romania, Hungary 
 and the Bandera rats from Ukraine, threw millions of forces, Wehrmacht's best, 
 75 percent of their Air Force, into the invasion, but that Stalin and the Soviet Union 
 Was prepared and succeeded in resisting. One of the reasons was the wonderful 
 The intelligence service, the comrades write. Another Joseph Stalin's handling 
 of diplomacy. Furthermore, the Soviet Union used strategic defense along with it 
 Burnt earth's tactics and partisans behind enemy lines. They blasted Soviet 
 dams and dismantled factories so that the enemy should not get anything like 
 preferably. The German Nazis could not imagine that the socialist 
 The mother country would take such measures to combat them. </p>
<p>The comrades write that the dictatorship of the proletariat stood at stake, the revolution stood 
 at stake, and that one could not stop to think or allow himself to stay 
 hindered in some way. They write about heroic partisans, who were left behind 
 behind enemy lines alone with rifle, ammunition and vodka, to wait for 
 the enemy, and that the German Nazis lost an average of ten men to each such 
 Partisan when they were liquidating them. </p>
<p>The comrades write that one cannot forget Stalin's leadership, when considering 
 him, and how he always held on to the importance of the morale of the war, 
 how the conquered tabs and chin crosses from the Nazis were thrown on the ground 
 in front of Lenin's Mausoleum. The major military victories were also made to moral 
 wins. They write that the Brazilian comrades have stated that the victory against 
 Fascism in World War II is one of the major events in the process of it 
 Proletarian world revolution. Three important imperialist powers, Germany, 
 Japan and Italy, were defeated. This must be considered, highlighted and celebrated.
Antifascist war shows the enormous life force of the socialist system, that 
 imperialism is the source of all wars in modern times, that the people will prevail and 
 that imperialism is a paper tiger and that to defeat imperialist 
 Aggressors must be united people's revolutionary forces in all countries and form it 
 widest possible international front to gather the strokes against the main enemy of 
 the world's people. </p>
<p>The comrades end like this- "With the honorable red army rifles, Nazi became 
 Germany crushed, socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat rose in East- 
 Germany. That the red tab of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union waved over 
 The dark and broken German rich stag is undeniably a great moment for 
 the international proletariat that symbolizes the entire heroic and honorable 
 epic struggle against fascism in defense of the Soviet Union and for the development 
 of the proletarian world revolution. The statement from comrade dimitrov when he 
 set course for the Soviet Union after the big victory at the Nazi tribunal in 
 Leipzig was thus fulfilled- "We will create Soviet Germany!" " </p>

 Strikes ". Photo- Sean Smith/The Guardian </p>
<p>On February 1, more than half a million workers declared a strike 
 and held demonstrations and pickets throughout the UK against the crisis and 
 repudiating the law that restricts the right to strike. The strike mobilized at least 
 300,000 teachers from 23,000 schools, 100,000 public servants of more than 
 100 departments, 100 thousand railways and 70 thousand university professors, 
 In addition to thousands of students who supported the mobilization. </p>
<p>Workers required a greater salary increase than inflation, which 
 reached 10% in 2022. In addition, they also denounced the constant worsening of 
 living conditions of the people in the face of the escalation of the crisis in the United Kingdom, which generated 
 A loss to real salary between 10% and 23% in the last ten years. To the 
 demonstrations also denounced the “Law of strikes”, currently in the process of 
 English Parliament. The new legislation seeks to restrict the right to 
 some sectors of UK workers by imposing a “minimum level of 
 Services ”that should remain in operation during mobilization. </p>
<p>In addition, education workers, students and parents of students 
 condemned the constant precariousness of the UK educational institutions, 
 result of budget cuts and austerity measures that 
 have intensified since 2010. </p>
<p><strong> Protests and pickets throughout the UK </strong> </p>

<p>The mobilizations began on Wednesday morning. In London, capital 
 from England, public servants, teachers and students 
 pickets in important schools and administrative buildings in the country. THE 
 Your Majesty Office(departamento responsável pelo desenvolvimento das
finanças e medidas econômicas do Reino Unido), the department for business, 
 Energy and industrial strategy and the school <em>bishop Thomas Grant</em> were some 
 concentration and blocking points for the mobilization of workers. </p>
<p>Also in the capital, thousands marched from different parts of the city, as 
 <em>Portland Place</em> and the Center of London, to Westminster Palace, where 
 They denounced the effects of the crisis and budget cuts on the people. Protests 
 occurred in Whitehall, another area of the city of Westminster, and in 
 Leisure Center <em>Glass Mill</em>, in southeastern London. </p>
<p>In addition to crisis and inflation, the precariousness of education was a central theme 
 in the manifestations. Company employees for student loans, from 
 Office for students and the department for education added to the 
 teachers and students in complaints about the state of education and 
 educational institutions in the United Kingdom. “We have to use very old books that 
 have been used over the years, they are shattering and need to be glued 
 With tape, ”said Lucy MacDonald, an English teacher at the <em>bishop 
 Thomas Grant</em>, to the Press Monopoly <em>The Guardian</em>. Other protesters 
 denounced that many schools in the region are without the heaters linked, 
 Despite the very low winter temperatures. </p>
<p>In Birmingham, pickets were erected at multiple points of the city from 
 8am, as at the entrance of the <em>Midlands</em> Western Office and the 
 Office of the betting committee, where they received support from passersby in the 
 shape of horns and gestures. A demonstration in the city center gathered 
 hundreds of workers who denounced the crisis, the cuts in the pensions and the 
 precariousness of universities. Anne Buttner, Secretary of the University of 
 Birmingham, he told the press monopoly <em>the Guardian</em> that “people 
 They are exhausted and exhausted. You can see, everyone is out [on the street]. To the 
 nurses are out, the railroads are out, the employees of 
 Trails are out, postal service workers are out. AND 
 Encouraging to see that we are not the only screaming in the emptiness. There are many 
 us". </p>
<p>Throughout the march, the workers sang the protest song “I prefer 
 be a 'piquetteiro' than a bullshit ”, a song that became famous in the decade 
 1980 during the English miners' strike against reactionary measures 
 From Margareth Thatcher. </p>
<blockquote>

2022</a>Protests and pickets occurred at school <em>Myrton</em>, in Warwick, 
 <em>Harris Academy School</em>, in Luton and the Cathedral Coral School of 
 Bristol. The students and parents of the students met with the teachers, 
 railways and servers in mass marches in the city of Manchester, 
 Wokingham, Brighton and Bristol. “Our disputes may be separated, but we 
 We have a single goal, ”said Seb, a pilot of high-speed trains
same city stated that loss in real salary is accompanied by a 
 increasing exploration. According to him, teachers need to deal with a 
 number of higher students each year and a workload that requires them to 
 work on weekends. </p>

<p>Outside England, the mobilization hit the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, 
 In Scotland, and the universities of Ulster and Dublin University in Ireland. 
 In the latter, teachers denounced the precarious working conditions of 
 Profession colleagues who have less stable contracts. Posters erected by 
 they exclaimed complaints like “I worked flu and fever because 
 I have a medical license ”and“ the possibility of having a house with stability or 
 Retirement is a distant dream. ” </p>
<p><strong> Number of misery workers increases every year </strong> </p>
<p>The general strike on 02/02 occurred in a context in which the rates of misery 
 in the United Kingdom have increasingly increased, the result of rampant inflation and 
 recession that, according to the Bank of England itself, must last for 
 less until 2024. A 2023 report shows that approximately 13.4 million 
 Of people in the country were in poverty between 2020 and 2021. </p>
<p>In addition, at least 74,230 families were left homeless or were at risk 
 imminent to lose it between January and March 2022, a number that exceeds in 
 11% the previous quarter. Of these families, 10,560 had people employed 
 In full -time works and 25,610 were families with children. Ellie 
 Clark, a worker interviewed by <em>The Guardian</em> 
 02/01 denounced that the situation is “very, very difficult”- “I am 
 Always worried that I am a crisis away from living on the street. That I 
 I am there is a payment to turn homeless. We are simply living in 
 Poverty, ”said the worker. </p>
<p>In addition to the lack of housing, the food has also become less and less 
 Accessible- Food inflation reaches 16.7% in the UK. In 
 September 2022, at least 9.7 million people were in a state of 
 “Food insecurity”. Increasingly, families in the country report the need 
 to buy ultra -processed foods, such as hamburger meats or sausages of 
 Hot dog, because they are cheaper. Food banks, which almost not 
 They existed in the region in 2010, now proliferate throughout the United Kingdom. A 
 Trussell Trust, food manager, recorded 300 thousand new 
 users alone in the first half of 2022, one fifth of which they were 
 of families who had at least one person with jobs. </p>
<p>Given this, the popular mobilization has also grown for better 
 Life conditions, as was realized on 02/01. In 2022, <a href="https-//anovademocracia.com.br/noticias/17759-reino-unido-
ferroviarios-realizam-maior-greve-dos-ultimos-30-anos">the railways 
 performed the largest strike of the last ten years</a>, in the same period as 
 bus drivers and application drivers went to the streets to demand their 
 rights. During <em>Black Friday</em>, <a href="https-//anovademocracia.com.br/noticias/18402-black-friday-e-marcada-por-
protestos-e-greves-de-trabalhadores-da-amazon">workers from <em>amazon</em> of the country 
 paralyzed their activities</a>against overexploitation. Two 
 months later, tens of thousands of nursing professionals went into 
 strike for better working conditions. On 03/02, a strike of 
 Ambulance drivers and nurses in Wales ensured an increase 
 salary from 6% to 7.5%. Nurses, rescuers, paramedics and telephone telephone 
 England's emergency also promised to mobilize in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/aaaaa.jpg" />Workers raise <em>outdoor</em> and posters with consignment <strong> protect the right to 
 Strike</strong>. Photo- Kirsty O'Connor - PA Images/Getty Images </p>
<p>In addition, workers have denounced the "anti-coat law". The measure in 
 discussion is a letter from the English imperialists to make it even more 
 The organization of strikes and struggles is difficult. However, the immense mobilization that 
 shook the whole UK demonstrates that the workers will not lower the 
 Head and are willing to follow in the fight.</p>

 Precarious. </strong> </p>
<p>The struggle of the workers in contract for Beretta looks at all workers and 
 to their condition. From the defense of health and workplace in 
 factory, to unity with the other realities that fight, in participation 
 to the National Assembly of February 18 in Rome. </p>

The workers on strike have 
 denounced '<strong> ba </strong> <strong> stands we can't take it anymore to run all day, to 
 cold, </strong> <strong> so we only break our back </strong> 'just as the 
 New Inail data on the strong increase in accidents and diseases

 arrogant, anti -union, _ like the 50 euros given in December as gratify 
 Only to the workers who have not striked, _ or leverage the double load 
 that the workers and mothers of the factory have in the assistance to the children by example, 
 with a real retaliation made of changes on duty and times, 
 sudden and personalized, to put uncomfortable workers in difficulty, 
 force them to make fatal jumps with babysitters. And of course of the 
 failed attempts to hinder the strike, which resolved, in front of the firmness 
 of the workers, in a frustrated </strong> </p>
<p><strong> Post(cancellato all'arrivo delle risposte)- 'They were 10 escaped home'. NO 
 I just don't think they ran away from the house, they have full brown to work 
 in those conditions. </strong> </p>
<p>The strike showed the new contract with MPM of 31.5.22(denunciato anche con un esposto)made in a hurry for the open investigation 
 -oprile 22- from the Guardia di Finanza 'against illegal use by 
 Beretta delle Cooperatives to always have manpower available 
 available and underpaid, explicitly defined as a transhumance of 
 workers', as a facade and commercial operation; How to download on 
 all responsibilities cooperatives; as if to cancel the fact that, i 
 results of the exploitation of precarious work and underpaid of the contract, 
 of the disgusting CCNL Multiservizi, increase the profit of Beretta. </p>
<p>With the signing of UIL, the changing contract was concluded without transparency 
 and the guarantees claimed by the Slai Cobas Sc about the lines of 
 processing actually passed to MPM. </p>
<p>The contract thus becomes the Trojan horse to remove one by one lines 
 to the workers who are struggling in the factory with Slai Cobas Sc. 
 They manage more to keep the rhythms of the factory. In recent weeks they are 
 lines 4 and 5 are removed, the control islands, which must return to 
 MPM workers who have been in those positions for years and years. <strong> The contract used 
 To hit 'SottoBanco' the workers. </strong> </p>
<p>With the strike there was a participatory and self -managed by the workers 
 press conference, significantly in front of the ATS headquarters in Trezzo, with 
 Journalists of Milan Today, of the day, those of the Gazzetta della Martesana 
 and of Radio Popolare and some independent ones who carry out investigations on the world 
 of work, all involved by the protagonism of the workers, who have 
 Started with several voices, to tell each other, to say enough, to change. </p>
<p>Unlike what happened so far, with the workers consumed on 
 Beretta processing lines, put out or who have left 
 silence, perhaps recommended by a trade unionist to accept the offer of 
 Conciliation of the company, as inevitable. </p>
<p>The day of January 31, part of a <strong> 360 ° mobilization, as mentioned

<p><img alt="" src="Images/uss-george-w-bush.jpg" />The monster nuclear -powered aircraft carrier "George W. Bush", which a few ago 
 Days participated in military exercise with the Zionist state of Israel, 
 It is now in the bay of Faliro and will remain there until Tuesday 7 
 February. In fact, special NAVTEX was issued by the Greek Coast Guard according to 
 which prohibits' traffic and anchoring of vessels, ships 
 marine leisure means, as well as any other activity at a distance of one thousand 
 The ship, and around it. " </p>
<p>At the same time that the US-Natia-Natia warlike confrontation 
 In the long -suffering territory of Ukraine is in a sharpening, pretending to be very 
 Dangerous developments for peoples, the bourgeoisie of the country provides us every 
 Types of amenities and facilities in NATO murders!With the narrative 
 of the ... right side of the story delivers the whole country by 
 Alexandroupolis up to Souda in NATO's services and plans 
 War machine installing bases everywhere. After all, very recently the 
 Prime Minister said that the Aegean islands are ... NATO!</p>
<p>But our people know very well what American imperialism and NATO will say. 
 We know very well that they are the ones who have been chopping for decades and 
 destroy entire countries(Γιουγκοσλαβία, Ιράκ, Αφγανιστάν, Συρία)in 
 Frames of their war plans. They are finally those who give birth and 
 giggling the uprooting of millions of people from their place with their 
 Refugee currents. As we also know that in the context of geopolitics 
 their designs have supported - whether disguised, or open - in many 
 Countries, the most reactionary-rioting forces. These are the 
 Imperialist bosses of our country's bourgeoisie. Their own plans(όπως και των ιμπεριαλιστών της ΕΕ)have served all the 
 Governments. </p>
<p>The ... "hospitality" of the "George W. Bush" aircraft carrier is one more 
 challenge for our people, who comes to add to that of the imminent 
 Visit to the Murder spokesman, Blinken, to our country. A people with 
 deeply anti-war-anti-imperialist feelings, who wants peace and 
 Friendship of peoples. The narrative that imperialists-"patrons" ensure the 
 Peace and stability in the area is a big lie. On the contrary- 
 In order to ensure their balances and interests, they feed 
 The nationalism, hatred and the confrontation of neighboring peoples. If the 
 demand their interests, may lead whole peoples to 
 mutual slaughter!</p>
<p>The right side for peoples is the one who shouts that they do not need from 
 patrons. Demonstrating against war and imperialist 
 interests. Fighting for peace and friendship of the peoples!</p>
<p>The visit of the "George W. Bush" monster cannot be left unanswered 
 From our people. Like all the country converting the country to free 
 field of action of the NATO war machine, of our involvement in 
 Imperialist confrontation in Ukraine. On the streets the people claim and 
 It imposes his right!To be back on the streets to shout- </p>
<p>Outside the "George W. Bush" aircraft carrier from Piraeus!</p>
<p><strong> Outside the bases and NATO from our country!
 </strong> </p>
<p><strong> No involvement in war!
 </strong> </p>
<p><strong> Peoples do not need patrons!
 </strong> </p>
<p><strong> Solidarity- Peoples' friendship!
