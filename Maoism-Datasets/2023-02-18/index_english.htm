<p><strong> A press release </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/proletari comunisti/2023-02-17T09-03-00-01-00/temp.png" /><strong> It is right that Zelensky speaks at the Sanremo Festival </strong></p>
<p>The prosecutor is strongly in favor of Zelensky's intervention at the Festival we will disanare. The President of the Republic of Ukraine represents a country independent and sovereign attacked and partially invaded by the neo -Nazi warning from the Putin warflower, so Rai did well to allow him to speak at Festival. Cantal fun and information on an event that could be able to coexist in a new world war.</p>
<p>The masked friends or in fact of the Russian imperialism supported by Chinese Chinese, such as Salvini, Dinucci, Rizzo, Acerbo, Vauro, Mattei, Di Battista and De Magistris, I scream, in particular through the "fact" of Travaglio, Conte and Putin, because They do not want the spectators of the festival to know war crimes, especially neiconfronti of civilians, which the new Tsar Putin is making in Ukraine. They are existing their servility towards Putin under the cloak of peace, but Lace can only be obtained with the victory of Ukraine. Just as it happened, in the 70s of the last century, in Vietnam and Cambodia attacked the American imperialism.</p>
<p>Long live the resistance of Ukraine!</p>

<p><strong> INAPP, Occupation: "Extraordinary unpaid for a worker out of six.ma is the tip of the iceberg: half of the employees works at Oreriantisociali </strong> <strong>" </strong></p>
<p><strong> FADDA: "</strong> <strong> The problem in general invests the regulation of ramper times. There is a risk of eroding and significantly distorting the dismissed needs. It is urgent to start a serious reflection on the eart -articulation organization of the working time, but also on his quantity edistribution. "</strong></p>
<p>Rome, 10 February 2023 - One in six employee worker(15,9%)unpaid fastraordinaries. A worrying figure, if we consider that Glistordinari interest six employed out of ten(60%), mostly men(64.7% against 54.1% of women). Le motivazioni sono di vario tipo: nella</p>
<p>maggior parte dei casi (51,2%)For excessive workloads or dural deficiency, in 18.4% to earn more. Then there is 8.1% who declares Dinon to be able to refuse.</p>
<p>It is one of the phenomena detected by the Inapp Plus investigation(<em> Participation, Labour,Unemployment Survey </em>), which involved 45,000 individuals from 18 to 74 years old, he concluded in 2022, whose final report will be presented to the institute's headquarters soon.</p>
<p>The problem of the extraordinary, however, is inscribed in the more generally theme regulation of life and work times that see a data of the employee emerge: about half of the employees carry out their activity at hourly hours could be defined as antisocial. Specifically, 18.6% of the deidnts work <em>sia at night that on holidays</em>(about 3.2 million people), 9.1% also on Saturdays and holidays(but not the night), while 19.3% <em>and</em> The night(but not on Saturday or holidays). Gli uomini sperimentanodi più sia il solo lavoro notturno, sia quello svolto sia di notte che neifestivi; le donne, invece sono impegnate più il sabato o nei festivi.</p>
<p>"Spesso la domanda di lavoro richiede disponibilità che confliggono con leesigenze di vita - ha dichiarato il professor Sebastiano Fadda, presidentedell'Inapp - È vero che per alcuni settori economici, come il commercio o lasanità, e per alcune professioni, come quelle dei servizi, il lavoro notturnoo nei festivi è connaturato alla natura della prestazione, ma è anche vero chequesta modalità sembra diffondersi anche dove non è strettamente necessaria. Èurgente avviare una seria riflessione sull'organizzazione e articolazione deltempo di lavoro, ma anche sulla sua quantità e distribuzione".</p>
<p>"While elsewhere we are discussed, and you start experiments, of reduced time short host - Punctuated Fadda - in our country they still remain dasing old work organization models that heavily affect life times. The world of work is increasingly digital, faster , inconstant evolution, but for most of the "traditional" workers, still unresolved problems on the level of the distribution of the hourly work. The permanence of uses and habits of the past often often prevails on finding balanced organizational solutions, both in terms of adding where necessary, and and In terms of lightening of the weight of hours of hours in general, which allow a sustainable balance between work and private-social life in the perspective of "work, and yet, the combination of new technologies, high skills both organizational organizational models should generate levels of productivity they do not make you need "inhuman" work of work, but guaranteed quality: well paid, protected, with high productivity ".</p>
<p>Moreover, always according to the report, a certain rigidity is also recorded in front of the permits: 21.3% of employed(about 4.7 million)Declare you cannot or not want to take permissions for personal reasons, 54.8% can be able to modulate them and the remaining 23.9% can modulate work commitment. Men's greater autonomy, while for women the pressure of context that disincentive the use of permits is highlighted. And they are above all gliautonomas that carry out their activity in a condition of Para -ubordination to declare that in their own work contexts or no permits are expected to be well seen to take them.</p>
<p>Then there is the other side of the medal, that of the consistent altitude disagreements, or employed that would like to work a greater number of diorship than those actually carried out. This unduoring is more of women - also for the greater concentration of the component female in part -time - among the workers with low study qualifications, between irescents in the north -west and south and islands and for those who carry out their own activity in small companies dimensions.</p>

<p>_ Foreign APPLE, 10 January 2023_ - In less than a year, the number of Italian soldiers lined up in Eastern Europe with Ukrainian, Russia and Belarus has increased by five, the number of Italian military. <strong> On the 7,000 actually employed in international missions almost 1,500 operate in the field born in the "containment" of the Russian Armed Forces. </strong> Starting in 2014, Alleanzaatlantica gave birth to a war escalation on the east side as never before in its history In the Baltic republics, in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, large terrestrial, aerial and naval installations were created, the most advanced war technologies have been transferred, the strategies of global conflicts of the 21st century have been tested with the use of drones and entirely automated weapons, enuclear cyber-spatial.</p>
<p>Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 24 February 2022, the trial rearm and militarization of Eastern Europe is dangerously dilated and still appears unstoppable today. <strong> And Italy is there with its troops, the emergency brigades, the Obici, the tanks and icacciabombardieri "Death Jewels" of the military-industrialnactional complex and foreign partners-partners, first </strong></p>

<h1>The old 'theory of both aspects of government' returns to Brazil - the new democracy</h1>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/A Nova Democracia/2023-02-17T21-13-11-03-00/arton49132.jpg" />There are situations, in politics, where the most powerful forces of the modern classes are compelled to resort to opportunistic forces in the Popular Movement to govern their system of exploitation and oppression in the face of dangerous insinstability to their maintenance. This occurred, for example, Nalemanha, in the period after the First Imperialist World War, when social democracy was raised to the government. In Brazil today - with all devivable proportions - similar phenomenon is observed: in the face of catastrophelonist in the management of pandemic, the profound overall crisis of capitalism and its state apparatus, and in the face of Bolsonarist attempts to precipitate an institutional rupture in the face of an offensive recruitory in Course, the most important sectors of the adominant classes conflined with the election of Lula, even though seeking to impose on him his government program, than derived contradictions and disputes.</p>
<p>Faced with scenarios such as these, opportunists and revisionists always raises the need to intervene in order to change the composition of the government, supporting “more progressive” aspect and seeking to weaken its “real estate aspect”, “throwing it” to the left. It is the flag erected, now, by several political departments of the false opportunist left. This controversy, which is not new either unknown its disastrous results.</p>
<p>One of the experiences emerged from a similar context was in Indonesia. In 1945, he triumphed the national liberation struggle with the active participation of that country's partisanist(PCI). Instaurou-se a República, num governo decoalizão que abarcava as classes dominantes e o Partido Comunista, governoliderado por Sukarno – figura reacionária com palavreado nacionalista emedidas reformistas. Influenciado pelo revisionismo, o PCI definiu que erapreciso apoiar Sukarno já que seu governo de coalizão supostamente produziauma mudança de qualidade na situação, e que, naquela coalizão, havia doisaspectos: um progressista e outro reacionário. Os revisionistas definiram,portanto, a tática daquele momento: a conquista de ministérios e gabinetespelos setores “progressistas”, a derrubada dos setores reacionários dogoverno, a ser garantido pela mobilização constante de massas.</p>
<p>The PCI, after these events, carried out a self -criticism of the “theory of the two government aspects” and to have been deluded on the reformist reform measures and for forgetting that the armed reaction can only be defeated by the revolution.</p>
<p>Revisionists and opportunists advise us to go this way, but conservative differences in conditions: historically, the current government is far behind what was the reactionary government of Sukarno, including the political accumulation of mass mobilization that had produced the proclamation of the public at that time; Just as our opportunists are much more right than the PCI itself. Offering expectation in the current reactionary government government is even worse than expected something at Indonesia from 1948.</p>
<p>Revisionists can see no more than what is low to their nurses, revealing that they are supporters of US pragmatism emoidology and unionism in politics. The revolutionary path remains: fighting the coup and the far right, boosting the claims of masses and, at the same time, making the masses see that they can and do not even expect from the reactionary coalition of opportunists and the right-wing, but to count on their own revolutionary organizations themselves and class independence.</p>

<p>We hereby publish a joint statement signed by the Swedish Communist Association, Anti -Imperialist Federation [Finland], anti -imperialist collective [Denmark] and Red Front [Norway]</p>
<p><em>Proletars in all countries, unite!</em></p>
<h3><strong> Against Swedish and Finnish NATO membership!For Socialist Revolution!</strong></h3>
<p>After Russian imperialism's war of aggression against Ukraine started on24. February, the Swedish and Finnish imperialism decided to join the Sigden North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO). NATO er et redskab for USA-imperialismen - i dag den eneste hegemoniske supermagt - til sin hegemoni, derprimært er rettet mod de undertrykte nationer, i overensstemmelse medhovedmodsætningen i verden, og sekundært er det præget af deinterimperialistiske modsætninger, primært mod atomare supermagt af russiskimperialisme.</p>
<p>NATO har ført og fører stadig aggressionskrige mod de undertrykte nationerover hele verden. Det har f.eks. mange igangværende »fredsbevarende«operationer i Afrika, og det blev også brugt i den berygtede krig modAfghanistan (2001-2021)And in Yugoslavia in the 90s.</p>
<p>To understand the Swedish and Finnish NATO processes, we must look at the interests of US imperialism, ie. That it needs to counteract the Russian aggression to consolidate its gains in so-called Eastern Europe after the collapse of Soviet social imperialism in the early 90s, and it is also in competition with its European energetic "allies," especially German imperialism. On the other hand, Den American Imperialism is moving its focus to East Asia to combat Chinese imperialism and try to curb its ambitions, and for this purpose, the United States needs a secure base in Europe. Therefore, it is the need of US imperialism to strengthen NATO's "eastern flank" by incorporating Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>But it is not against the will of these less imperialists. On the contrary, DEDEN utilizes interimperialist competition between the larger imperialists, and they also have their own interests in Eastern Europe, especially in the Baltic.</p>
<p>Swedish and Finnish NATO membership will mean greater reactionarization and militarization of the ancient states, greater decay of imperialism and the size of all the basic contradictions. Thus, the objective conditions of anti -evolution are even more mature, which emphasizes that revolutions are the main trend.In this great and delayed task, the Communists in Sweden and the Finnish eyes have rigidly aimed at the most advanced battle in some NATO country, namely the Power War led by TKP/ML, following its mighty example and letting sig-inspirers of it.</p>
<p><strong> down with NATO, an Imperialist Alliance!</strong></p>
<p><strong> live the revolution and the People's War!</strong></p>
<p><strong> For the reconstitution of the communist parties!</strong></p>

<p>In great national mobilization, nursing professionals performed a whole of protests in defense of their attacked rights. Nurses, assistants and technicians from all over the country held demonstrations, blockages and paralities on February 14 with the unified agenda that requires the tax salary, barred by decision of the Supreme Court.(STF)in September 2022.</p>
<p>The acts took place in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Amazonas, Rondônia, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco. They clash with the decision of the Dominator Luís Roberto Barroso of the Supreme Federal Court(STF). O ato foiconvocado nacionalmente pelo Fórum Nacional da Enfermagem (Fne), which stateshaver indicative of national nursing strike for March 10 if workers' claims are not fulfilled.</p>
<p>The suspension of the law occurred after it was questioned by the private health billionaires and reactionary politicians who present the excuse that “there is no money” to ensure a worthy salary for health professional. There are more than 2.5 million health professionals at nobrasil affected by the outdated salaries. Like other sectors of work in the country, they are being subjected to exhausting working hours, often without vacation and paid rest.</p>
<p>They exercise their profession in scrapped and crowded hospitals from patients, in a profession with a high degree of unhealthiness. The national movement equals hypocrisy that, during the Covid-19 pandemic, all the reed sectors, including the monopolistic press, criticized Bolsonaro's military government for “not valuing health professionals” and now they do the same.</p>
<p>The application of the floor would guarantee nurses the amount of R $ 4,750; for auxiliary and midwives, 50% of the value, ie R $ 2,375; and for de -nursing technicians, 70% of it, equivalent to R $ 3,325. Only for comparison, Odieese points out that for a Brazilian family to live with dignity the value of the minimum overcoat should be $ 6,575.30.</p>
<p>While the nursing salary remains outdated, a salary increase of18% to the STF ministers was approved with peace of mind and will be made from April 1 this year, in the amount of R $ 41,650.92.</p>

<p><strong> from the presentation </strong></p>
<p>Let's start this cycle of training that we called EducationMarxist, a sort of "class university", because the workers, lelavrators, workers must know, must know for having analysis autonomy, of evaluation that serve above all not to pert for us this knowledge , but to arm us, to transform reality, because this reality is not immutable, it is not that there must always be who knows and who is exploited, who dominates and who is dominated.</p>
<p>It is important to have a scientific knowledge, but it is known that it clearly also asks for commitment, attention, that we need it precisely to do precisely or not to be like sponges that absorb ideas, the dialytrs analyzes, which are 99% ideas and analyzes that analysis that They want to make current laesuitation eternal, the reality of the bourgeoisie, of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>This decision to make these basic Marxist training cycles with the Abiamopresa together with Rome in the anti -capitalist proletarian assembly of 17 -sixtembre. So this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>Each time the cycles will be made on a seat in a city, but with collegamentocon the other locations, with the other cities.</p>
<p><strong> The "lesson" of prof. Marco's</strong></p>
<p>Tonight we have to start this demanding cycle of work, so we have a few bluntly to work, I will try to be as clear as possible, clear Pusnon can mean simple, they are two different things, because the matter is overcomple, it is a science and therefore it is complex and science yes she studies.</p>
<p>We decided on this new course between the Rome Assembly and a meeting that we had on the net. Other years we have made meetings of this kind, however, dedicated to the study of a text by Marx, Engels or Lenin. This year, instead we do a different thing, that is, we do not do a rampant cycle on a single text, a single book by Marx Or Engels or Lenin, we mafaccia a themed speech, we try to isolate a problem, a theme.</p>
<p>Let's start from Marx's critical work to the science of the political economy.Marx has passed greatAnd then I begin by saying that Marx at 26 wrote in Paris, after being away from Germany, three notebooks dedicated to the political economy in which he, in one of the salary, capital, interest, profit of the CAPITAL and land income , in another of private property and in another of private property and communism. These three texts, this oneimanuscript were published only in 1932 and were known for economic-philosophical such as 1844.</p>
<p>Then the motions of 1848 broke out, therefore, and we are in 1849, he and engelsfunded a magazine, the new Rena Gazzetta where Marx wrote a series of the DIESTORIAL who were taken by conferences that kept the workers on the report waged work and capital and you can find it in a Agile volume, <em>Lavorosalariato and Capital</em>, for example, a volume that during the course of Editadi I would suggest you to read this year. In these conferences he kept on the Operai he explains the waged work, the capital, even if he had not made the fundamental discoveries he then did.</p>
<p>When he went into exile he studied money in London. He stood 10 years old(In the meantime he had begun to get sick)To work to clarify the enigmadel money, because here we have to talk about money, in short, but to arrive at the goods, to the capital.</p>
<p>In August 1857 a great capitalist monetary crisis broke out, and Marxisse: here is the opportunity, and that was the Stura to publish seven notebooks on 1857, the outbreak of the crisis, and 1858: 7 Notebooks where he made a blaze of his criticism in the 'Political economy, not published: they are called the fundamental links of the criticism of the political economy, _ were unplugged with the German name <em>grundrisse.</em> Then the long study on the political economy began.</p>
<p>Marx had made a great project for the scheme of the political economy, located in the following topics: the first, the capital, the second, the annuity, the third topic, the salary.</p>
<p>The first two are the masters ... the salary are always the masters who ciaboard workers and exploit them ... therefore capital, land and salary annuity. Esono, said Marx, the three parts of civil society: capitalists, ownership(The owners of the earth)and wage workers.Then, after capital, land income, salary, we have three other parts: state, foreign trade, world market, and then the crises. So six parts, these were the sections.</p>
<p>Then the project had to be financed, but there were difficulties(The fact that he was sick, the fact that he had no money, at a certain point Ifigli who died him ... then received a small inheritance after the death of the Madre and then the project ended up)Under pressure from the publisher in 1859 he published a first part. Then he had to start this very first part of this galactic thing, the capital, Ecio is two chapters dedicated to goods and money. The Grundrisse begins Coldenaro to get to the goods, but then Marx understood that in the exhibition to understand, we had to speak before the goods and then of money; leave more complex and then break it and go to simple thing.</p>
<p>He wrote these first two chapters, the goods and the money; He gave them to the publisher because he needed money, later he stopped. But, he said then the workers had read and understood them.</p>
<p>In the early years of 1860 he finally began to splash all the other parts, that is, capital, land income, salary, state, foreign trade and marketing market. But at this point he understood that he had to find a point that binds these things and understood that if he traced everything to the concept of capital, you understand better: the capital, <em>ist</em>, is, <em>der inbegriff</em>, means the laquinasnce of the thing, because it collects.</p>
<p>So what started to do? First of all he began to write about about the political economy, after which what does he do? "Caregiappa" thisocapital and sees that it is made first of all. The profit, made of course, with the sweat of the workers, the master lords if they are loyal between the actual profit of the industrial capitalist, the banker interest, and land income, that is, of the land owner, that is, of the earthly reproducentaire which can also be the owner of the mines, The Property of the properties(For example, Mr. Mittal has all the things: the profit part of the industrialist, that of the owner, we do not know banks). Quindi qui c'è la spartizione tra questeclassi che, dice Marx, sono fratelli nemici, che però quando si devonospartire il bottino si comportano come una vera massoneria verso gli operai.</p>
<p>In 1867, another economic crisis, another commercial crisis, and Marxpubblica finally made another work that spoke of the capitalist process of the Diproduction, entitled <em>The capital, criticism of the political economy</em>, here is i'capitale ', but as regards the process production capitalist.</p>
<p>Then after him he began to work on circulation, that is, the product, the goods, must be sold, and then he began to study circulation(To make you understand: the logistics, the warehouse where the goods station before being was).</p>
<p>Nel 1871 ci fu la Comune di Parigi, cioè gli operai si impadronirono per unmomento del potere, e questa cosa naturalmente cambiò tantissimol'organizzazione della Internazionale per cui Marx ed Engels avevano avviato ilavori. Dopo la Guerra franco-prussiana e dopo la sconfitta della Comune diParigi il centro del movimento operaio, delle lotte operaie si trasferì dallaFrancia alla Germania dove nel 1889 si arrivò alla Fondazione della SecondaInternazionale.</p>
<p>Marx, vuoi per motivi di salute, vuoi perché anche quel genio aveva giàscritto queste cose in appunti, non poté chiudere per la pubblicazione i suoiscritti, proprio perché aspettava sempre qualche crisi che gli confermasse lesue ipotesi.</p>
<p>Poi nel 1883 morì, e allora Engels che cosa fece? Engels pensò bene dipubblicare queste parti non pubblicate. Pubblicò la parte sulla circolazione elo fece diventare il secondo libro del capitale, intitolato <em>Il processocapitalistico di circolazione.</em> In verità Marx gli aveva detto di fare cosìprima di morire, ne avevano parlato. La terza parte, la spartizione delprofitto tra i vari capitalisti, per cui Marx aveva lavorato al contrario diquello che uscì fuori, perché aveva studiato tutta la spartizione delprofitto, poi s'era guardato la produzione, poi si era guardata lacircolazione, cioè era partito dal più complicato per arrivare alle parti…proprio come un biologo che piglia un animale e prima lo guarda tutto intero,poi lo comincia ad anatomizzare, a spezzettare nelle sue parti, e poi ha dinuovo l'intero (So I explained to you the Chesi scientific exposure technique calls dialectic, dialectic is precisely this way of proceeding: there is first of all, as they say technically, an immediate intuition, then I break, here is the analysis, then you have a new synthesis who gives you back the previous one, but but you have passed through it).</p>
<p>In fact Marx before he died was interviewed by an American journalist who asked what he really is, being? And Marx replied: The struggle, because the movement is.</p>
<p>This method had also intuited it, even if he did not know what he did, Darwin, who had studied the organic world and had actually discovered this, but he since Marx says, he was a bourgeois influenced by the marketing jetting of the "case": It happens by chance, instead there is an internal law, Emarx discovered it for society but we see that it also works throughout wool.</p>
<p>Now we have to extract from everything these things that I said what Ciserve to continue gradually to penetrate this story: capital, land income, wage work, state, foreign trade, world market, bearing in mind that the quintessence is to bring it back to of capital.</p>
<p>So now let's try to take a step forward again.</p>
<p>Before, however, I must say something that I had forgotten, that of mentioning the most important twooperes for Marx: one came out in the years 1843-44 and was called_Lections of criticism of the political economy_- but only that it was Marxche was not Marx, he had A mask and his name was Federico di surname Engels ... without this work Marx would not have started working, Engels anticipated him, prepared the job. Then another economic work of Engels always: <em>lasiation of the working class in England</em>, a milestone on Cuimarx builds his work. In the first book of the capital, the production processionary process, in the eighth chapter on the working day, which is the heart of the whole problem, Marx explicitly refers to _ "_ _la s__station of the working class in England" _ of Engels, who in the Suogeniale Written presents us the champion for the fight of the working day, the English working class.</p>
<p>However, all the genes do this, that is, they start from the work already prepared here da altri, in fact Engels said of Marx: he is a genius we are talents, if I would like to say what is the most important thing from which to start a path inmarxism must be started from <em>la Situation of the Ayninghilterra working class._The political economy is responsible for defining what wealth is. This is an object of political economy, and in this sense it is a modern science. Evoi will answer me: and why in antiquity, in the Middle Ages, there were no poor rich, there was no wealth? Answer: Yes and no!There was, but it was another, modern wealth presents itself as follows: each has it in their own money. This is why the political economy must be started by Daldenaro, because this is the specific form of modern wealth; Ancient larica was another thing, it was probably not called even, because Marx says in the _grundrisse: _ "at the ancients I did not find an investigation on which form of land ownership [because the property was clearly there, there were no industries evidently] Create the productive wealth, greater. Wealth does not appear as the purpose of production ... the investigation is always aimed at establishing which form of properties creates the besticittters ". So the problem of the ancients was not what the production formation was, but which production creates the best citizens, because ancient ancient had the problem of forming the best citizens(The best entrances of the _aristoi, aristocrats</em> <em>)</em> _, _ the best citizens of spiritual insane.</p>
<p>But why, do you say, those didn't struggle? The slaves worked!The ones called like this, <em>instrumentarium vocal</em>, production tools, while the animals were <em>instrumentarium semi -vocal</em>, semivocal tool tools; And the slave is not a citizen, he was below equindes, democracy was the democracy of whom? Of these citizens who eranomed land owners, not large landowners, non -landowners, medium, the average class. A great great theorist, poet, governor, of antiquity - was called Solone - he had made the division of the lands Ele had distributed equally among these average citizens who could also poigrazie to this landed property armed by himself and make the army perceiving the base Army to protect the citizens who armed themselves from himself this was ancient democracy, that is, the democracy of these proprietarimeds, in fact Solone had put stunned stones that marked the variouspropriety. So you see that here wealth is not the problem, IlProblema is of the best citizens, that is, wealth is not the purpose of the production but the purpose of production is to form the best citizens.Marx continues, "therefore the ancient conception of the world according to which man, what his limited national, religious, political determination is the purpose of the production, seems very high towards the mondomoderno, in which production presents itself as The purpose of man and the wealth of the purpose of production ".</p>
<p>It seems that the ancient conception for which man is the purpose of the production is high of the modern conception for which production is the purpose of man and wealth the purpose of production and below there is a sharing, but modern to arrive for Understanding that there is a losfrutation, for the ancients no, because the ancients appeared natural, the order of nature appeared.</p>
<p>This is why political economy can only be born in the modern world, where man is the purpose of production, but production is the purpose of man, and wealth the purpose of production ...</p>
<p>So, what should we get to go to socialism? You must get to the production that has man has the purpose of the production, but Nonci you can get on the assumption of the ancients if you do not ask slavery, you have to arrive through everything that produced the shit.</p>
<p>Many of the "companies" think of overcoming capitalism returning to who knows the ideal world that has never existed, the small producer, no. You have to do this step to get to find the man, this is Ilpunto. Therefore Marxism has argued with anarchism.</p>
<p>Our problem is to understand this paradox, which is not a paradox, that is, to go through the negative to get to the world in which man is as the purpose of production; But passing through this, why? Why do you have the world market, the great industry, the mobile phone, etc., all that you can build rationalism on rationalism.But it is not only the trade, we have made progress, because trade is universal of gold, because marketing means money, goods, the commodity of prosperity, says Marx: in moments of prosperity, Ilgido resounds "only the goods is money", That is, the rich man who holds the goods and checommercia, is the moment of the first colonization, the Eastern Indies, the Netherlands; Instead in moments of crisis only money becomes important. Imonetharisti understand the bank, the merchant understands the exchange.</p>
<p>But there is one, however, this is also unilateral, why yes, trade, but who produces the merchandis commercial? does not go down from heaven? There is someone who Ladeve produce. Behind the goods who is there?</p>
<p>And another great current arrives, now we are in the 18th century, now people arrive, smart, a current arrives called the physiocrats, who are they? There is a great exponent, it's called François Quest. Work called <em>Tableau é economicque</em>, economic table; These are very digrand economists behind the French Revolution. What do you do? They presented themselves as a feudal economists, defended the earth, but behind these faces, behind these signs, these present themselves medieval clothes dresses, instead below they said a very modern thing, these say: the real wealth is the earth, the source of wealth It is the agricultural_lavoro_, it begins to come out _The work, _ the agricultural work. For the products of the earth you create the means of subsistence to eat with the products and the woods of the mines you create the means of production to pearly, so you see that the earth And agricultural work are the source of technician. And here Marx says: this is a great progress, compared to the Aimonatristi and to the mercantilists we have made enormous progress, because we have been arrivaricated to something that is truly universal, that is, without agricultural work without work in the mines, etc., you may have means of production Emezzi of subsistence? You already see the constant and capital capital here already, means of production and means of subsistence; You have Ilsalario in a nuce and you have the capital in a nuce.At this point what discovered this this question? That the earth is commendable, and the French revolution was born on this prerequisite, that is, the thieving of the feudal lands and the possibility of selling the earth. It is not Comevi they taught at school that at some point the French revolution. What does it mean? Do you get off the sky? It is prepared!It means that already Louis XVI was now taking place. Lenin writes a very step on the failure of the international II when he says: "Unarivoluration why breaks out"? Not only because there are those who are exploited and do not be exploited more, but also because the exploiter can no longer be kept old relationships ... ".</p>
<p>Marx is very good at understanding the importance of these who begin to discover theplus value. And how did they find out? A great Italian physiocratic, Ferdinando Paoletti said it: "Look at the superiority of the agricultural worker: we put a plate of peas in the hands of a cook who takes these eti peas makes an exquisite dish, put it in the hands of a farmer and lets out unquitral" … Here is the agricultural work it produces.</p>
<p>But there was still unilaterality and now we come to the culminating point of political economy, now it can come from the outside world, from the industrialist, the first prince of the political economy, the largest Adamsmith, author of a book, coincidentally: <em>The wealth of nations ._And here comes the political economy, where the problem is however: that _l economy remains at this point</em>, that is, established that wealth is work, why Marx says, but before Marx others had said it, the worker, that is He who works and goes from one job to another more produces epiù wealth impoverishes? To this the political economy had not given response.</p>
<p>And then, at this point, all of people who were called social reformers began to appear in England, who before Marxsi began to ask for all this, that is, why the utmost wealth of the maximum misery, as never right in England, in The one where the utmost wealth traders, producers, there was the Maximamiseria.</p>
<p>This is all the problem that the economy understands, and it is the greatness of questions. Adam Smith, and then later another, David Ricardo, cynical erare, says Marx Cinici, but who said the truth, because they were doing well produces misery. So? <em>Q</em> <em>Uesto</em> is the way of producing ... without concern, the political economy itself shows us with the Suecami that the production of maximum wealth is the production of maximum misery, feel this piece of the manuscripts of 1844: "But since according to Smith it is not a happy society The one in which the majority suffers and since the state's weight loss state leads to this suffering of the majority and the political economy that leads to this stage of maximum wealth, Ilfine of the political economy is therefore, he says, the unhappiness of society. "What does it mean: it is true, Marx tells us, in antiquity man was the purpose of reproduction, in modernity production is the purpose of man and the wealth of production aims and then the ancient world presents itself as an ancient world, while The modern one presents ourselves empty ... and empty us ... it's true, says Marx; But once you have erased the bourgeois form it is not wrong that production is the purpose of man, so wealth is the purpose, it is enough to understand that we want to understand by wealth, if by wealthy bourgeois, that sucks, but if wealth means the full hestrunt of man, of his creative faculties, an end in himself, that is, I work as well, but it is not that I have to work to be exploited, I do it because that creates me and therefore it is I who want to give up the rest for it as I want to do it , I can, Marx says, perform the most tiring activity that is there but because I decide it. Then this most authentic sense that production is the purpose of man, because this time production becomes the production of man himself.</p>
<p>But you see that you can do it only on the basis of the modern world, you have to pass through all this because capitalism has created the conditions pending ahead.</p>
<p>You see how the practice lies in science, so I'm not telling you any residence, I'm not telling you the sixth commandment, I am saying that reality necessarily brings you there because through the alienation we have created these conditions. It is, says Marx, to be aware of it, but the condition is there and this is this, here is the criticism of political economy.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong> Our comrades in Bandera Roja(Red tab)Has published an important statement dated January 2023, from Peru's Communist Party Committee in Lima. VIKEGOVER OUR READERS TO TRY TO READ THE WHOLE TEXT BUT HARD NUMBERED SOME OF THE CONTENT HERE. </strong></p>
<p>The Peruvian comrades write that the general crisis of imperialism, mainly because of an acute and deep economic crisis, once again tightening the basic contradictions of imperialism, and in particular the main contradiction: imperialism -underprinted nations.</p>
<p>This creates very good objective conditions for developing the national liberation movements, writes the comrades, and the folk wars have contributed to the Åmeners International Communist Federation, as a historical and transcendent step towards a communist international under the command of Avmaoism.</p>
<p>The comrades describe how the interimperialist contradictions are also sharpened, and how the world's only hegemonic superpower, Yankee imperialism, is in decline with inflation, recession, protectionism and "danger of civil war" and "separatism". On the other hand, the scriptures, the Russian nuclear sustained power have recovered some positions, and develops strategic plans to undermine Yankee imperialism, along with the Chinese Social Memperialism. The change for rivalry is the oppressions in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Russian and Chinese imperialism's influence especially through bureaucratic factions of bourgeoisie oppressed countries in these continents.</p>
<p>Latin-America is the "backyard" of Yankee imperialism, and here their hegemonia-diminished Russian and Chinese military, political and economic support offers fields in Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Boliva and so on. From mining, but it contributes only to 10% of GDP. Peru is the world's second largest manufacturer decobs and zinc, and the third largest manufacturer of silver and tin in Latin America, although only 1.07% of the country is used for mining. More than 98% are considered "virgin territory" and this is a cake the United States will have for itself, but where Chinese and Russian imperialism penetrates. The comrades write: "We are part of their prey, but we cannot give our consent. Let's defend the Federation with the war!”.They describe how the Folk War in Peru reached the strategic equilibrium, the other political and military stage of the war, in 1991, which awakened fear and brutal rage from Yankee imperialism. Through their Lakeialberto Fujimori, they conducted a "self-coup" on April 5, 1992, as a joint IYANNE plan to further develop the so-called Lav-intensive war against the denomination war. In this way, they could put in an even more Yankee-dominated, fascist, crowded and traitor-stained regime, with long-term plans for decades of counter-revolutionary extermination war. A new Constitution blend in 1993, as part of the so-called "fourth restructuring" and the preparation in the middle of the genocide, a constitution adapted to the needs and interests of the Yankee imperialism.</p>
<p>This Constitution became a backbone of the crowded, fascist and country -traitor regime, which struggled to give the bureaucratic capitalism new impulse, to relaunch it, under the cover first of "social market economy" also of "free market economy". This so -called "neoliberalism" erased away -nationalized industry, increasing the penetration of foreign imperialism of the imperialism of the imperialism even more. Politically, the President's power, the presidential absolutism, and the Constitution also opened to freer hands inheritance and navy, in order for these to develop their folk murderer war against the war led by Peru's Communist Party.</p>
<p>The fascist click of Fujimori and Montesinos fell in the year 2000, and the CIA Ogoas helped establish a transitional government. Opportunists applauded, writes the comrades, as it advocated for superficial changes, with support from the citizenship. At the same time, the semi -Føydals character in the economy is strengthened, and a rotten bureaucratic capitalism is developed on assistance, among other things, by the free trade agreement with the United States. Russian and Chinese imperialism are now undermining US imperialism with increased penetration into Peruvian economy. It has an impact on the split in the citizenship of the interconnection fraction and the bureaucrat fraction.</p>
<p>The comrades in the party write that all this forces the people to go the only way: the democratic path developed as the path of public liberation, led by the vendor who is Peru's Communist Party, a path to establish power to the proletariat and the Peruan people. Camera writer: "Is there any other way? That's why we say: Folk War to Communism!”The election in 2021 was held in this context, and the bandit and anti -communist pedro Castillo were chosen. The comrades write that he is an opportunist across, who has defended the interests of the bureaucrat fraction in the bourgeoisie, on behalf of the Castroist party PL dominated by the Cerrón family. The Denne character was supported by all kinds of revisionists and opportunists, among the rats in Movadef and Vraem. Thanks to this support, Castillo Funning the long-planned murder of chairman Gonzalo, the great-theme of our time of our time.</p>
<p>Castillo's presidency intensified the faction struggle in the citizenship. Unsetuated outward Castillo, but at the same time planned for his fall, in conspiracy with the Keiko-leden fascist combador fraction. The armed forces supported this fall, and it was blessed by the church.</p>
<p>The comrades greet the heroic Peruvian people, who have risen to combat the pro-imperialist, bourgeois and reactionary powers. There is a wave of protests throughout Peru.</p>
<p>The enemy, for his part, is led by Yankee lackeys such as Dina Bolarte, Otarola, Zapata and Goméz de la Torre, with a dream of splitting Peru and diverting the growing revolutionary struggle from especially the poor farmers and the proletariat in particular. Dederal, writes the comrades, about crushing the proletariat's voter, oral communist part. The comrades write: “They dream that with the help of the revisionists and opportunists of all kinds, can continue to save their ownly -made regime. We say: Dream on. ”(Our translation.)</p>
<p>The comrades write: “The genocide they have begun in the south now goes through the country. The blood that runs will never be forgotten!The more blood, the more oppression, the more the war, the more revolution !!Only the people judge and punish the men!Against oppression and genocide, for national rights and the war!”</p>
<p>And further: “They aim to destroy all resistance from social and popular movements, trade unions and parties and so on, but mainly they dream of preventing the party's advancement, which today goes on and puts a solid basis in its general reorganization and in the restructuring of People's Employment Army. ”</p>
<p>The comrades write that we live in historical times, where the country and the people fell into the worst crisis in their history. They are reminiscent of chairman Gonzalosord that the nation is again in danger and that the enemy will tear it to pieces. Fills so that there is no stone back on stone. They write they live in a revolutionary situation, as defined by Lenin. Describe that chairman Mao teaches us that the revolutionary situation affects the basis of the basis, and closes all ways out than one: the revolutionary path.</p>
<p>The comrades eventually greet a number of slogans to the proletariat and the people, and they greet the first United Maoist international conference and the foundation of the International Communist Association(Ekf).</p>

They formally filed a resolution, along with the Makabayan bloc, Sahouse of Representatives on February 15 to investigate the sudden turn of Roxas Holdings Inc. They also interviewed the representative in Congress to gain support for their call.</p>
<p>According to Sugarfolks Unity for Genuine Agricultural Reform(SUGAR)-Batangas, approximately 12,000 farm workers and more than 7,000 small plantaries have lost their livelihood due to unjust closure of the sauce. "It destroys the local sugar industry not only in the province, but across the country," the group said.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the government's sugar-bangas insisted on buying and overseeing the CADPI operations to save it to strengthen the local sugar industry in the province.</p>
<p>According to Christian Bearo, Sugar spokesman, it will greatly affect the Batangas plantators because only 4,500 metric tons of sugar can be grown by the remaining sugar mills in the province compared to the Cadpi's 12,000 metric tons per day. At the forefront of 2020, the CADPI covers 10,980 hectares of the province.</p>
<p>Bearo explained that the local government of Batangas had earlier pledged to pay the transportation cost of ₱ 30,000 per truck to travel to the Central Azucarera de Tarlac(CAT). Subalit anito, hindi kayangsagutin ng lokal na gubyerno ang gastos para sa 200 trak kada araw na umaabotsa halos ₱6 milyon.</p>
<p>Naiulat din na magbibigay ng ₱80 milyong ayuda sa 2,000 manggagawa at maliliitang plantador para makaagapay. Reklamo ng SUGAR, di ito sapat at kaunti lamangang masasaklaw nitong manggagawa at plantador. Giit ni Bearo, dapat itongmagbigay ng subsidyo sa paggawa sa lahat ng mga manggagawa sa tubuhan nabahagi ng produksyon at sapat na kumpensasyon laluna sa maliliit na plantador.</p>
<p>Insulto umano ang kainutilan ng Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA)It says all it can do is to convince Cadpi to reopen for this year.</p>
<p>According to Sugar, the government should give the Small Plantadors a subsidy of production, especially fertilizer. This is in addition to buying the grinder.</p>

<p>We publish a joint statement signed by the Communist League of Sweden, theAnti-imperialist League(Finland), Anti-Imperialist Collective(Denmark)andRed Front(Norway).</p>
<p><em>Proletarians of all countries, unite!</em></p>
<p><strong>AGAINST SWEDISH AND FINNISH NATO MEMBERSHIP!FOR SOCIALIST REVOLUTION!</strong></p>
<p>After the war of aggression by Russian imperialism against Ukraine started inFebruary 24th, Swedish and Finnish imperialisms decided to join the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is a tool of US imperialism – todaythe sole hegemonic superpower – for its hegemony, directed principally againstthe oppressed nations, conforming to the principal contradiction in the world,and secondarily it is characterized by the inter-imperialist contradictions,mainly against atomic superpower of Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>NATO has been waging and is waging wars of aggression against the oppressednations all over the world. It has for example many on-going "peace-keeping"operations in Africa, and also it was used in the infamous war againstAfghanistan (2001–2021)and in Yugoslavia in the 90s.</p>
<p>To understand the Swedish and Finnish NATO processes, we need to see theinterests of US imperialism, that is, it needs to counter-act the Russianaggression in order to consolidate its gains in the so-called Eastern Europeafter the collapse of Soviet social-imperialism in the beginning of 90s, andin this it is also in competition with its European NATO "allies", especiallyGerman imperialism. On the other hand, US imperialism is shifting its focus tothe East Asia to combat Chinese imperialism, trying to contain itsaspirations, and for this the US needs a secure base in Europe. Hence it is USimperialism's need to strengthen NATO's "Eastern Flank" by incorporatingSweden and Finland.</p>
<p>But it is not against the will of these smaller imperialists. On the contrary,they are using the inter-imperialist competition among the bigger ones, andthey too have their own interests in the Eastern Europe, especially in theBaltics.</p>
<p>Swedish and Finnish NATO membership will mean greater reactionarization andmilitarization of the old states, greater decay of imperialism, and greatersharpening of all the fundamental contradictions. Thus the objectiveconditions for revolution are even more ripe, emphasizing that revolution isthe main tendency.In this great and delayed task the Communists in Sweden and Finland have theireyes closely on the most advanced struggle in any NATO country, that is, thePeople's War led by TKP/ML, following its mighty example and drawinginspiration from it.</p>
<p><strong>Down with NATO, an imperialist alliance!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long live revolution and the People 's War!</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the reconstitution of Communist Parties!</strong></p>
<p>Signatories:</p>

<p>In order to understand Swedish and Finnish NATO processes, we need to see the interests of imperialism in the state of the state, it is, its need to make a counter-office attack in order to strengthen its achievements in so-called Eastern Europe after the collapse of Soviet social imperialism in the 90s, and here is also in competition with its European "Alliance" with German imperialism. On the other hand, US imperialism is moving its focal point to East Asia against fighting for imperialism, trying to damn its pursuits, and the USA needs a secure position in Europe. Therefore, there is a need for US imperialism to strengthen NATO's "eastern site" by incorporating Swedish Finland.</p>
<p>But it is not contrary to the will of these smaller imperialists. On the contrary, they use inter-imperialist competition among the larger ones, and they also have their own interests in Eastern Europe, especially in the Baltic States.</p>
<p>NATO membership in Sweden and Finland will mean greater recession and militarization, rottenness of greater ultra-profit, and greater implementation of all basic conflicts. Thus, objective circumstances for the revolution are increasingly cooked, emphasizing that the revolution is the main endurance.In this great and delayed task, the communist eyes of Sweden and Finland are strictly attached to the most sophisticated battle, which even in one of the NATO countries, in one of the NATO countries, the TKP/ML-led People's War, following a fading example and seeking inspiration from it.</p>
<p><strong> down NATO, imperialist alliance!</strong></p>
<p><strong> Live the Revolution and the People's War!</strong></p>
<p><strong> for the reconitory of communist parties!</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/ΚΚΕ m-l/2023-02-18T99-00-00-04-00/seismos-tourkia-syria-kourdistan.jpg" />We denounce the arrest by the anti -terrorist agency of the Turkish three Greek left young youths who went to the earthquake -stricken areas of Turkey in solidarity with the Turkish people and the neighboring country.</p>
<p>It is not enough that the Turkish state condemned and buried the lives of millions under the debris ... It is not enough that its policy has led to it inappropriate tragedy with the tens of thousands of dead ... It is not enough to have a total of condemnation of the neighboring people. Poverty, tone and poverty ... Now criminalizes the practical solidarity with the tested people, describes solidarity as "terrorists", while trying to control or even close any diodebells. In addition, he imprisones journalists, while threatening to arrest as many talks to the media.</p>
<p>Through such moves, the Turkish regime and the Erdogan government want to hide their enormous responsibilities and attribute them to a "natural destruction", as Erdogan hastened to describe it. They want to comply overall the character of the capitalist system of exploitation and oppression. Indifference, the legalizations of the building buildings meet anti -seismic standards, burned under the ruins of the poor in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the Turkish regime and despite the preachers of nationalist hatred by the dependent bourgeois classes on both banks of the Eujae, <strong> Our people stand by the side of the Turkish people. Against the nationalist poison, but also in complete contrast to crocodile tears, the local ruling class and the Mitsotakis government are launching tears, hoping to exploit this dramatic situation for their advantage. </strong> International and class solidarity does not fit into hypocritical bourgeois sermons. Is the only one -off hope within this unprecedented tragedy. **</p>
<ul>
<li>We denounce the arrest of the three left young youths and demand their immediate release. * We demand that every passage of solidarity be opened to the Turkish people, the Syrian and the Kurdish people. * We support every move of claiming the Turkish, Syrian and Kurdish people in their struggle to gain their right to life.</li>
