FOR SOCIALIST REVOLUTION!**\n\nAfter the war of aggression by Russian imperialism against Ukraine started inFebruary 24th, Swedish and Finnish imperialisms decided to join the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO is a tool of US imperialism – todaythe sole hegemonic superpower – for its hegemony, directed principally againstthe oppressed nations, conforming to the principal contradiction in the world,and secondarily it is characterized by the inter-imperialist contradictions,mainly against atomic superpower of Russian imperialism.\n\nNATO has been waging and is waging wars of aggression against the oppressednations all over the world. It has for example many on-going "peace-keeping"operations in Africa, and also it was used in the infamous war againstAfghanistan (2001–2021) and in Yugoslavia in the 90s.\n\nTo understand the Swedish and Finnish NATO processes, we need to see theinterests of US imperialism, that is, it needs to counter-act the Russianaggression in order to consolidate its gains in the so-called Eastern Europeafter the collapse of Soviet social-imperialism in the beginning of 90s, andin this it is also in competition with its European NATO "allies", especiallyGerman imperialism. On the other hand, US imperialism is shifting its focus tothe East Asia to combat Chinese imperialism, trying to contain itsaspirations, and for this the US needs a secure base in Europe. Hence it is USimperialism\'s need to strengthen NATO\'s "Eastern Flank" by incorporatingSweden and Finland.\n\nBut it is not against the will of these smaller imperialists. On the contrary,they are using the inter-imperialist competition among the bigger ones, andthey too have their own interests in the Eastern Europe, especially in theBaltics.\n\nSwedish and Finnish NATO membership will mean greater reactionarization andmilitarization of the old states, greater decay of imperialism, and greatersharpening of all the fundamental contradictions. Thus the objectiveconditions for revolution are even more ripe, emphasizing that revolution isthe main tendency.\n\nTherefore, for the Communists, it is not a question of defending theimperialistic and false "Nordic neutrality", as the revisionists do, but tostruggle for overthrowing the rotten imperialist order, which is essentiallyoppressive, reactionarizing and genocidal. This struggle today means thestruggle for reconstituting the Communist Parties for socialist revolutionthrough People\'s War in service of World Revolution.\n\nIn this great and delayed task the Communists in Sweden and Finland have theireyes closely on the most advanced struggle in any NATO country, that is, thePeople\'s War led by TKP/ML, following its mighty example and drawinginspiration from it.\n\n**Down with NATO, an imperialist alliance!**\n\n**Long live revolution and the People \'s War!**\n\n**For the reconstitution of Communist Parties!**\n\nSignatories:\n\nCommunist League of Sweden\n\nAnti-imperialist League, Finland\n\nAnti-Imperialist Collective, Denmark\n\nRed Front, Norway', 'categories': ['Yleinen'], 'source': 'https://punalippu.noblogs.org/post/2023/02/18/against-swedish-and-finnish-nato-membership-for-socialist-revolution/'}
