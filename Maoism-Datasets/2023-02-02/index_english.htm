<h1>On the 80th anniversary of the victory in the battle of Stalingrad</h1>
<p>The International Communist League correctly stated in its 'Political
Declaration and the Principles of the International Communist League'- <em>"</em> <em>We
assume the position of Chairman Mao on the role of comrade Stalin that he was
a great</em> <em>Marxist.</em> <em>Furthermore,</em> <em>we must bear</em> <em>in mind</em> <em>that</em> <em>he was the
one who brilliantly defined</em> <em>Leninism.</em> <em>We, the communists, today have the
task to</em> <em>assume the defense of</em> <em>his</em> <em>role in</em> <em>World War</em> <em>II</em> <em>within the
Communist International, particularly its 7</em> <em>th</em> ___World_ <em>Congress. "</em> The
latter will be central for this article celebrating the tremendous victory in
the battle of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>The weight and significance of this great and heroic battle was correctly
established by Chairman Mao Tse-Tung- <strong>"</strong> <strong>This battle is not only the
turning point of the Soviet-German war, or even of the present anti-fascist
world war, it is the turning point in the history of all mankind. "</strong></p>
<p>The war fought by the USSR, as it was absolutely correctly defined, was a
Great Patriotic War, a just war of defence. Additionally to the glorious and
heroic defence, in which the USSR under the leadership of Comrade Stalin had
to apply scorched land to defend its territory, to defend the socialist
motherland, what costed more than 25 million lives, the anti-imperialist
struggle unfolded vastly in the oppressed nations during this period.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao Tse-Tung just and correct thought us- <strong>" The Soviet Union's
sacred war of resistance against fascist aggression is being waged not only in
its own defence but in defence of all the nations struggling to liberate
themselves from fascist enslavement. For Communists throughout the world the
task now is to mobilize the people of all countries and organize an
international united front to fight fascism and defend the Soviet Union,
defend China, and defend the freedom and independence of all nations."</strong></p>
<p>The peoples of the world rose for the just cause and spilled their precious
blood not only in the war against the axis, but also against their respective
imperialist masters, what initiated the great anti-colonial struggle in the
second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>In the winter 1941/42 the Soviet Union under the leadership and command of
Comrade Stalin had already successfully rebuffed a vicious Nazi-German attack
on the western part of the country, aiming to take the capital Moscow. The
Nazi-Wehrmacht, not able to understand that every attempt to crush the
Bolshevist steel tempered by the great Lenin and Stalin was doomed to fail,
mounted an offensive on southern Russia in the summer of 1942. They set their
sights on Stalingrad, because the city served as an industrial center in
Russia, producing, among other important goods, artillery for the country's
troops. The Volga River, which runs through the city, was also an important
shipping route connecting the western part of the country with its distant
eastern regions. The Nazis wanted the Wehrmacht to occupy Stalingrad, seeing
its value for propaganda purposes, given that it bore Stalin's name. For
similar moral reasons there was a special need to defend it. The 6th Army of
the Wehrmacht began their assault on 23 August 1942.</p>
<p>Comrade Stalin, as the highest command, issued personally the Order 227, at
the end of July 1942, in order to elevate the level of sacrifices and fighting
spirit of the armed forces to the level of the people-</p>
<p>" <strong>The enemy throws new forces to the front without regard to heavy losses
and penetrates deep into the Soviet Union, seizing new regions, destroying our
cities and villages, and violating, plundering and killing the Soviet
population. Combat goes on in region Voronej, near Don, in the south, and at
the gates of the Northern Caucasus. The German invaders penetrate toward
Stalingrad, to Volga and want at any cost to trap Kuban and the Northern
Caucasus, with their oil and grain. [ …] Part of the troops of the Southern
front, following the panic-mongers, have left Rostov and Novochercassk without
severe resistance and without orders from Moscow, covering their banners with
shame.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The population of our country, who love and respect the Red Army, start to
be discouraged in her, and lose faith in the Red Army, and many curse the Red
Army for leaving our people under the yoke of the German oppressors, and
itself running east. Some stupid people at the front calm themselves with talk
that we can retreat further to the east, as we have a lot of territory, a lot
of ground, a lot of population and that there will always be much bread for
falsehood, helpful only to our enemies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each commander, Red Army soldier and political commissar should understand
that our means are not limitless. The territory of the Soviet state is not a
desert, but people - workers, peasants, intelligentsia, our fathers, mothers,
wives, brothers, children. The territory of the USSR which the enemy has
captured and aims to capture is bread and other products for the army, metal
and fuel for industry, factories, plants supplying the army with arms and
ammunition, railroads. After the loss of Ukraine, Belorussia, Baltic
republics, Donetzk, and other areas we have much less territory, much less
people, bread, metal, plants and factories. We have lost more than 70 million
people, more than 800 million pounds of bread annually and more than 10
million tons of metal annually. […] To retreat further - means to waste
ourselves and to waste at the same time our Motherland. Therefore it is
necessary to eliminate talk that we have the capability endlessly to retreat,
that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that
there is a large population, and that bread always will be abundant. Such talk
is false and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, if we do not
stop retreating we will be without bread, without fuel, without metal, without
raw material, without factories and plants, without railroads. This leads to
the conclusion, it is time to finish retreating. <em>Not one step back!</em> […] It
is impossible to tolerate commanders and commissars permitting units to leave
their positions. It is impossible to tolerate commanders and commissars who
admit that some panic-mongers determined the situation on the field of combat
and carried away in departure other soldiers and opened the front to the
enemy. The panic-mongers and cowards should be exterminated in place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Henceforth the solid law of discipline for each commander, Red Army soldier,
and commissar should be the requirement - not a single step back without order
from higher command. Company, battalion, regiment and division - commanders
and appropriate commissars, who retreat without orders from higher commanders,
are betrayers of the Motherland. These are the orders of our Motherland. To
execute this order - means to defend our lands, to save the Motherland, to
exterminate and to conquer the hated enemy."</strong></p>
<p>Our heroic red soldiers were initially able to slow the Wehrmacht's advances
during a series of skirmishes north of Stalingrad, offering more than 200,000
lifes, and successfully held off the Nazi hordes. It was decided not to flee
but withstand and therefore not to evacuate the more than 400,000 inhabitants
of the city. The men and women, even the youngest, of Stalingrad were
incorporated into war related activities - combat, construction, espionage,
supply, etc. Even when the walls of Stalingrad bursted by the Luftwaffe's
constant bombardments or the heavy artillery strikes, the people stood
steadfast.</p>
<p>The Operation Uranus led by Georgy Zhukov and Aleksandr Vasilevsky organized
Russian troops in the mountains to the north and west of the city. From there,
they launched a counterattack. Paying the necessary price the Red Army was
able to encircle the city by late November 1942, trapping the nearly 300,000
German and Axis troops(mainly Italian and Romanian), choking off the enemy
forces from vital supplies and essentially surrounding them in an ever-
tightening noose.</p>
<p>Close to Stalingrad the Red Army won important battles, including in Rostov-
on-Don, about 250 miles away from Stalingrad. Thus the enemy forces were
thinned and stretched at that part of the front and the Operation Little
Saturn in the west of Stalingrad was successful. With men, not arms, proving
the Marxist principle about what is most important correct once again, they
strangled the invaders to death and fought the greatest battle of war in
cities ever seen. It was a war not only from street to street, nor from house
to house or cellar to cellar, not even floor by floor, but room by room,
generating the most heroism, chapters that have shaken the world.</p>
<p>On the significance of the battle of Stalingrad for the whole course of the
war Chairman Mao stated- <strong>" …in this present war the attack on Stalingrad is
the expression of the last desperate struggle of fascism itself. At this
turning point in history, too, many people in the world anti-fascist front
have been deluded by the ferocious appearance of fascism and have failed to
discern its essence. For forty-eight days there raged an unprecedentedly
bitter battle, unparalleled in the history of mankind-from August 23, when the
entire German force crossed the bend of the River Don and began the all-out
attack on Stalingrad, through September 15, when some German units broke into
the industrial district in the northwestern section of the city, and right up
to October 9, when the Soviet Information Bureau announced that the Red Army
battle was won by the Soviet forces. During those forty-eight days, the news
of each setback or triumph from that city gripped the hearts of countless
millions of people, now bringing them anxiety, now stirring them to elation.
</strong><strong>This battle is not only the turning point of the Soviet-German war, or
even of the present antifascist world war, it is the turning point in the
history of all mankind.</strong> <strong>Throughout these forty-eight days, the people of
the world watched Stalingrad with even greater concern than they watched
Moscow last October.</strong> <strong>[</strong> <strong>…</strong> <strong>]</strong> <strong>following the battle for the
defence of Stalingrad, the situation will be totally different from that of
last year. On the one hand, the Soviet Union will launch a second winter
counteroffensive on a vast scale, Britain and the United States will no longer
be able to delay the opening of the second front(though the exact date cannot
yet be foretold), and the people of Europe will be ready to rise up in
response. On the other hand, Germany and her European accomplices no longer
have the strength to mount large-scale offensives, and Hitler will have no
alternative but to change his whole line of policy to the strategic defensive.
"</strong></p>
<p>We all know, and we must remember, that the fascist offensive led by the
Nazis, to which the Italian and Spanish fascists as well as others like the
Romanians, Hungarians and also Bandera's bunch of rats from Ukraine
contributed, and which used all the economic might of subjugated Europe, threw
millions over millions, the cream of the German army, 75% of its air force,
into the invasion. But comrade Stalin had wisely handled diplomacy with great
subtlety.</p>
<p>It is worth noting the sagacity and penetration of the Soviet intelligence
service. What an intelligence service. They knew the exact day of the Nazi-
invasion.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union applied a strategic defence together with scorched earth,
leaving them nothing but bare earth, mud, ashes and the most brave, determined
and resolute partisans behind the enemies lines. They had the audacity, the
courage to blow up monumental works such as the famous dam that links the
Volga with the Don that took so many years of effort. The Germans never
dreamed, they thought that this work would not be blown up, because it was too
important and had cost a lot.</p>
<p>The dictatorship of the proletariat was at stake, the revolution was at stake,
we cannot stop to think, nor can we simply allow ourselves to be hindered, as
Chairman Mao said, by the defence of inches of land. They crashed at the gates
of Leningrad, at the gates of Moscow and Stalingrad; but not only</p>
<p>scorched earth was carried out, but guerrillas and even simple individual men
and women with their rifles, their ammo and their vodka awaited the enemy. To
annihilate one of those brave heroes and heroines, the Germans lost 10 men,
averagely.</p>
<p>The fascist offensive was a military plan of very high quality, thus, the
highest and most enlightened German military leaders elaborated this plan and
the German school has a many times proven war tradition- in three months they
planned to conquer the USSR.</p>
<p>Comrade Stalin's foresight, he had already taken measures since the 1930s when
there was the great transformation of the countryside and industry, they had
already transferred factories beyond the Urals, even foreseeing the
possibility of leaving as far as Moscow, for it is true, everything was</p>
<p>already in place in case they could not ultimately defend Moscow, even if that
was the decision taken, it was already planned to move the leadership and the
centre to the Urals; So the first thing that was done was to make arrangements
for Lenin's transfer, because he could not fall into the dirty hands of the
wretched sons of hell, he could not fall.</p>
<p>But the order, after they had penetrated to the above mentioned gates, the
order was not to retreat any further!It is very memorable, and we must always
remember how on November 7, the anniversary of the revolution, they had
nowhere to celebrate it and it was considered impossible to carry it out;
comrade Stalin said- "to the station", "but there is no platform there, there
are no seats there", comrade Stalin stepped on a box and spoke in celebration
of the revolution, saying- "how many of us were there when we seized power,
what forces did we have when we repulsed the imperialist aggression
immediately after the October Revolution? We will crush them, and we will
annihilate the beast in its own den, in Berlin."</p>
<p>These are things one must remember, to appreciate comrade Stalin one must look
at the Second World War. We all know how then came the great resistance, the
breaking of the German lines, the siege of Stalingrad where the German
commanders, Hitler himself, commanded them not to retreat to those inferior
subhumans. Those inferiors, the barbarians, the Mongols, hunted them down like
rats and they had to surrender.</p>
<p>It is always good to reiterate this- Stalin, the skillful and wise manager of
surrendered Nazis and threw their flags, their eagles, their swastikas at the
foot of Lenin's mausoleum; not only a great military defeat, but a</p>
<p>great moral defeat!The Nazi arrogance had been sunk in the mud and trampled
upon, it was the greatest moral blow it had ever received, and that was the
beginning of the breakdown of the Nazi Wehrmacht.</p>
<p>In February 1943 Comrade Stalin analysed- <strong>" Three months ago the troops of
the Red Army began their offensive at the approaches to Stalingrad. Since then
the initiative in military operations has remained in our hands and the pace
and striking power of the offensive operations of the Red Army have not
weakened. Today, in hard winter conditions, the Red Army is advancing over a
front of 1,500 kilometres(950 miles)and is achieving successes practically
everywhere. In the north, near Leningrad, on the central front, at the
approaches to Kharkov, in the Donets Basin, at Rostov, on the shores of the
Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, the Red Army is striking blow after blow at the
Hitlerite troops. In three months the Red Army has liberated from the enemy
the territory of the Voronezh and Stalingrad regions, the Checheno-Ingush,
North Ossetian, Kabardino- Balkarian and Kalmyk Autonomous Republics, the
Stavropol and Krasnodar Territories, the Cherkess(Circassian), Karachaisu and
Adygeisu Autonomous Regions and almost the whole of the Rostov, Kharkov and
Kursk Regions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ …] in the winter of 1942-43 alone, the Germans lost over 7,000 tanks,
4,000 planes, 17,000 guns […] since the beginning of the war, has put out of
action about 9,000,000 German-fascist officers and men, of whom no less than
4,000,000 were killed on the battlefield.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ …] first, the weakness of the German army is the shortage of man-power
reserves, and consequently it is not known from what sources these losses will
be replaced. […] the Red Army has become a seasoned army. […] millions of Red
Army men have become masters of their weapons […]</strong></p>
<p><strong>It cannot be considered an accident that the Red Army Command not only
liberates Soviet soil from the enemy but does not let the enemy leave our soil
alive, carrying out such important operations as the encirclement and
annihilation of enemy armies which can well serve as examples of military art.
This is undoubtedly a sign of the maturity of our commanders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There can be no doubt that only the correct strategy of the Red Army
Command, and the flexible tactics of our commanders who execute it, could have
resulted in such an outstanding fact as the encirclement and annihilation at
Stalingrad of an enormous picked army of Germans, numbering 330,000 men. "</strong></p>
<p>Our Brazilian comrades pointed out- The victory against fascism in the Second
World War is one of the great historical events of the process of the
Proletarian World Revolution, the imperialist camp found itself deeply beaten,
three important imperialist powers were defeated - Germany, Japan and Italy -
which has to be seriously studied for its just and correct comprehension, it
has to be highlighted and celebrated.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of China affirmed, regarding the evaluation of this
historic experience-</p>
<p>" <strong>In the first place, the history of anti-fascist war shows that the
socialist system has an enormous vitality that can resist the most severe test
and that a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat is invincible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In second place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that imperialism
is the source of all wars in modern times, that the aggressive nature of
imperialism will not change and because of that, to defend world peace it is
necessary to persist in the struggle against imperialism.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In third place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that the peoples
war sure to attain victory, that it is completely possible to defeat the
imperialist aggressors, that imperialism is a paper tiger, who is apparently
strong, but in reality is weak, and that the atomic bomb is also a paper
tigress and it is the people and not the arms, of any class, who decide the
outcome of the war.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In fourth place, the history of the anti-fascist war shows that, in order to
defeat the imperialist aggressor, it is imperative to trust in the unity of
the revolutionary forces of the people in all countries, to attract to our
side all the forces that can be won, to form the broadest possible
international united front and concentrate our blows on the main enemy of the
peoples of the world. "</strong></p>
<p>Under the guns of the glorious Red Army Nazi-Germany was shattered, Socialism
and the dictatorship of the proletariat arose in up to Eastern Germany. The
Red Banner of the Communist Party and the USSR waving over the shadowed and
destroyed German Reichstag is an undeniable great moment of the international
proletariat that symbolize the whole heroic and glorious epic of the struggle
against fascism in defense of the USSR and for the development of the
embarked in the direction of</p>
<p>USSR after the great victory in the Nazi Tribunal in Leipzig was thus
accomplished- <em>" We will make Germany Soviet!".</em></p>

<p>Since last year there has been an enormous increase in the terror of Israel against that

 Tated by Israeli occupation troops - the highest number in 15 years. 
 In January 2023 alone, 30 Palastinians were killed. </p>

<p><strong> Italy nuclear risk- the new bombs in Ghedi and Aviano </strong> </p>
<p>They are about to arrive from the United States also in Ghedi(Brescia)and Aviano(Pordenone)The nuclear bombs of "new generation" B61-12. They will replace the 
 Old B61-11 located for years in the military bases in Belgium, Germany, 
 Netherlands, Turkey and Italy as part of the so -called doctrine of 
 nuclear sharing, </p>
<p>NATO's "nuclear sharing". </p>
<p>They are called "tactical nuclear devices", but are no less dangerous than 
 "strategic nuclear bombs" present in the Arsenals of the United States, Russia, 
 China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. </p>
<p>The "adjustable power" of the new B61-12 varies from 0.3 to 50 kilotons, five 
 times higher than the Hiroshima bomb. But - they report peace and disarmament network e 
 ICAN campaign - they can explode under the earth's surface by increasing 
 Thus their destructive ability until they reach the equivalent of a weapon 
 bursting on the surface with a yield of 1,250 kilotons, that is about 83 bombs 
 Like the one used in Hiroshima. </p>
<p><strong> Today Italy is a possible nuclear target </strong> </p>
<p>All this makes <strong> ghedi </strong> e <strong> aviano </strong>, but also reflected <strong> Brescia </strong> e 
 <strong> Pordenone </strong>, <strong> Possible target in the nuclear war </strong>. An eventuality 
 Today no longer so remote- in recent months the Russian authorities have shown 
 The possibility of using tactical nuclear bombs in Ukraine. </p>
<p>In response, the administration of Joe Biden has decided to keep in 
 the possibility of using nuclear devices first, 
 thus renouncing to introduce the no First Use rule. Not only that- the rapid 
 change of the world scenario is also leading to the use 
 quote of nuclear weapons to defend what the American leaders and 
 Europeans define the "order -based order". </p>
<p>Nuclear bombs, even the "tactical" ones, can therefore no longer be 
 consider a tool of mere deterrence, but expose the populations of 
 territories in which they are stored to be targets of the "first shot" or of 
 Further retaliation.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Images/pintada-por-Perú-en-Quilmes-Berazategui-Varela.jpg" /><strong> 1. </strong> <strong> Long live the rebellion of the Peruvian people Enough of repression!</strong> </p>
<p>The rebellion of the Peruvian people follow in the streets and the 
 Repression with more than 63 killed, thousands of prisoners and injuries. </p>
<p>From the PCR and its JCR and all the mass movements of which we participate 
 We promote a great mass campaign in solidarity with the 
 Peruvian people, repudiating the fierce repression. </p>
<p>The coup d'etat overthrew President Pedro Castillo and imposed the 
 Dina Boluarte de facto presidency. The Congress, controlled by the right 
 Fascist, rejected the possibility of a new election this year. </p>
<p>All imperialisms recognized the coup government. They dispute associated 
 to different sectors of the Peruvian ruling classes, but they converge to the 
 time to suppress popular mobilization and quell the rebellion. </p>
<p>In Peru the imperialist dispute stains the situation of the country. The traditional 
 Right Proyanqui has given ground to the advance of imperialism 
 Chino, who has become the main commercial partner of Peru and controls 
 Copper(Perú es el segundo productor mundial)And it has important 
 strategic investments, including the construction of the port of Chancay 
 About the Pacific, key to the advance of Chinese penetration on America 
 from the south and for its imperialist dispute over the Pacific. </p>
<p>Also Japanese imperialism has important investments that advanced 
 mainly during the presidency of Fujimori. </p>
<p>The rebellion of the labor movement and the originals and peasants of the 
 interior of the country, it has been mobilizing large caravans from the provinces 
 Andean and the popular neighborhoods of Lima. </p>
<p>To that popular mobilization was added a caravan of reservists and graduates 
 of the armed forces, of more than 10,000 members and say that they would reach 
 Lima 30,000. A fact of enormous importance, that fractures the structure 
 military and adds to the popular claim to sweep the government and congress 
 coup plotters </p>
<p>The president of Mexico, López Obrador, requested the release of the president 
 Overthrown, Pedro Castillo. Democratic claim that could not be approved in the 
 Recent CELAC meeting. </p>
<p>The depth of the rebellion of the peasant masses, originally, workers, 
 Student and popular Peru claims deep changes. Until where 
 This fight will arrive will depend on a avant -garde capable of opening a 
 Revolutionary path. But surely nothing will be the same in this 
 Brother country. </p>
<p>Our duty as revolutionary communists is to raise this situation between 
 The masses in each workplace, study and militancy, so that there are 
 hundreds of pronouncements in solidarity with the heroic struggle of the people 
 Peruvian and <strong> to demand the Argentine government to claim Pedro's freedom 
 Castle and repudiate the coup d'etat. The Peruvian people are the sole owner of 
 your destiny.</strong> </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> 2. </strong> <strong> The Russian invasion to Ukraine and World War </strong> </p>
<p>“War is a failure of politics, a failure of humanity, a 
 shameful claudication, a defeat against the forces of evil. If we think 
 that in this last century there were three world wars, 1914 to 1918, 1939 to 
 1945 and <strong> This current one that is a World War. ”</strong> The statement belongs to the Pope 
 Francisco for Russian invasion to Ukraine. </p>
<p><strong> Putin underestimated the Ukrainian people that </strong> endorsed that patriotic war. 
 Russian imperialism has used much of its missile reserves to 
 destroy buildings and kill the civilian population, looking for a genocide that 
 Sow fear and get a quick triumph. And it was quite the opposite. </p>
<p><strong> Russian invasion to Ukraine places the world on the edge of a new war 
 world.</strong> </p>
<p>The United States will now send 31 Abrams tanks. The Biden government 
 He decided after Germany agreed to send 14 leopard tanks of his own 
 arsenal. The German government had said that the Leopard was not going to send to 
 less than the United States made the Abrams available. </p>
<p>In total, France, England, the United States, Poland, Germany, Holland and 
 Sweden will send around 160 tanks and armored vehicles. </p>
<p>Russian imperialism responded to these ads with a new wave of 
 Missile and bombing attacks on kyiv and other cities, and prepares a 
 Great offensive that moves forward to the arrival and commissioning of the tanks. </p>
<p><strong> Out of Ukraine Russian genocidal imperialism!Out of imperialism 
 Yankee and NATO!Long live the heroic patriotic struggle of the Ukrainian people!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> 3. </strong> <strong> The CELAC and the new scenario of Latin America </strong> </p>
<p>Last week, the meeting of the CABA was held at the Hotel Sheraton de la Caba 
 Community of Latin American and Caribbean States(CELAC). </p>
<p>Alberto Fernández presided over CELAC for a year. Was designated as successor 
 Ralph Gonsalves, imposed by Mexico. It is the Prime Minister of San Vicente and 
 the Granada, a small island of the Caribbean, of English speaking, that still
Gonsalves maintains good relations with Cuba and Venezuela, and reiterated support 
 from his country to the Argentine demand for the resumption of negotiations with the 
 United Kingdom regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. </p>
<p>The presence of Lula, the new president of Brazil, opened changes in the 
 Region- proposed to resume and strengthen Mercosur, negotiate first with 
 the European Union and then with China. Mercosur integrates it- Argentina, 
 Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela(suspendida desde el 2017). And how 
 Associated states- Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Surinam. </p>
<p>With Lula, negotiations for commercial exchange and the 
 possibility of financial aid to Argentina. It was important 
 Presence of Evo Morales, the former president of Bolivia. </p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a video to CELAC in which he said 
 "The world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformations" and 
 He called to "boost South-South cooperation." </p>
<p>Social and union organizations discussed and presented a document with 
 his claims and his anti -imperialist positions, as the partner said 
 Ramiro Berdesegar, leader of the CCC and the PCR. And on 24/1 they mobilized 
 massively to the Sheo, the CCC, the Evita Movement, the CTA and other forces 
 popular </p>
<p><strong> 4. </strong> <strong> Disputes in together for change </strong> </p>
<p>The pro and together for change are a "cat bag" and live a fierce 
 Dispute for charges for this year's elections. </p>
<p>After the triumphalist climate for victory in 19 provinces in the elections 
 Of 2021, the internal dispute with the rebellion of provincial leaders grew- 
 Tucumán, Chubut, Salta, Córdoba, Río Negro and others. </p>
<p>Patricia Bullrich(PRO), Gerardo Morales(UCR), Maximiliano Ferraro(Coalición
Cívica)and Miguel Ángel Pichetto(Encuentro Republicano Federal)They met 
 This Wednesday, as presidents of the forces that make up together for the 
 Change. They agreed to "sanction" those who do not comply with the internal rules of 
 The alliance for early elections. They try to put a limit to 
 disputes over the lists of the provinces. </p>
<p>Macri was planted- "I'm in the ring and I'm going to fight." Elisa Carrió, marked the 
 court to together for change- she wants to be a candidate for president to search 
 unit". </p>
<p>Manes asked to expand JXC, and asked Schiaretti to not move on the 
 Elections in Córdoba. </p>
<p>The former Buenos Aires Governor María Eugenia Vidal, who is also noted in the 
 Presidential career, speaks of a pension reform "because the system is 
 broken ”, and wants to“ discuss ”the compensation system. </p>
<p>This 12/2 are made internal in La Pampa, in which together for change it goes 
 to decide its candidates between radicalism and the Pro. The Front 
 Pampas justicialist unified his lists with little democratic discussion and not 
 It goes to internal. </p>
<p>Beyond its internal disputes, macrismo and the sectors that support it 
 They want to return to the government to deepen adjustment, hunger and delivery. 
 <strong> It is those who direct the main blow of the popular struggle. </strong> </p>
<p><strong> 5. </strong> <strong> The trial of the Supreme Court </strong> </p>
<p>Congress began to deal with the possibility of a political trial to the Court 
 Supreme Justice. On February 2, the complainants will present and on 9 
 will vote. </p>
<p>The government needs two thirds of the Senate and deputies to approve the 
 political judgment, but it does not have or follow half of each of those 
 Chambers with what the political trial is hard to prosper. </p>
<p>Beyond this, this discussion puts on the table the corrupt actions of the 
 Argentine Justice and its Supreme Court, which show the 
 rot of the institutions of this state of the ruling classes, which 
 It is used by the different sectors in your dispute, and also to repress and 
 discipline social and political organizations such as CCC and PCR to 
 through judicial causes tailored to its adjustment policy. </p>
<p><strong> 6. </strong> <strong> Unit in the streets against adjustment, for bread, work and sovereignty </strong> </p>
<p>Quilmes neighbors looted trucks with cattle and the meat is distributed in the 
 Street- They don't have to eat. </p>
<p>They continue to increase food, rentals, fuels, 
 rates, prepaid and telephony. The price of the cow increased 17%, which 
 The meat would rise to 40%. </p>
<p>In the agrarian areas the drought left the worker without work and the chacarero 
 indebted. They lost the initial crops and now they are losing the 
 late Many poor peasants and small producers leave their fields and 
 The concentration of the Earth grows in the hands of the pulses and large 
 landowners. </p>
<p>It is urgent financing, subsidies and soft credits, hitting the sector of the 
 Earth owners, which are carried out as income 7 billion 
 dollars, with a special tax. Also a rural lease law that 
 allow the producer to rediscuse the rent in emergency cases such as the 
 Current drought. </p>
<p>The <strong> social emergency </strong> is not the center of government policy. He
and other outsureres from outside and inside, cutting social plans, 
 salaries and retirement. ** </p>
<p>With that great lie that the exit to this situation comes from the 
 Diversification of the agency, the agreements that take over 
 our natural wealth and our sovereignty. </p>
<p>A court approved the exploitation of oil in Mar del Plata- to the Shell!
 The company of those who colonize our Malvinas and our sovereignty in the 
 South Atlantic and in the Antarctica sector. They celebrate the delivery of lithium in 
 Gross, when Bolivia exploits him with a national company. </p>
<p>Imperialist oil companies impose fuel prices with Super 
 Profits. Vaca Muerta and Cerro Dragon continues to dismembered at the hands of the 
 Imperialist companies. </p>
<p>The dispute for our resources grows. The government gives in to the 
 export monopolies and about the control of the so -called hydrovy. He 
 Government of Tierra del Fuego negotiates with China the construction of a port 
 strategic. And Lewis continues to take over Patagonia, giving it to the 
 English imperialism. </p>
<p>With this policy the government has lost popular support, because it does not touch the 
 interests of the powerful and hunger, poverty and delivery of 
 Our national sovereignty. This emboldenea to the reactionary right in their 
 plans to deepen the adjustment, as Milei did announcing his "plan 
 chainsaw ”to reduce the State and eliminate health ministries, 
 Education, work and women and diversities. </p>
<p>The workers, peasant, native, young people, of the young people, of the 
 women, the struggles in defense of our sovereignty. There are thousands in Argentina 
 Those who come starring their claims and join in the streets </p>
<p><strong> We continue in the fight to advance these struggles and join with all the 
 popular and national sectors so that these converge and impose from the 
 streets that the crisis is paid by those who are taking it in shovel and breaks 
 The infamous agreement with the IMF and all anti -informed agreements with different 
 Imperialism. Only in this way can we advance in solving emergencies and in the 
 Defense of our national sovereignty. </strong> </p>
<hr />
<p><strong> 7. </strong> <strong> Follow the head of the struggles and not underestimate the enemy </strong> </p>
<p>Companion Sebastián Saldaña, coordinator of the CCC of the city of Santa 
 Faith, he received at home a threat of death to him, his son, his baby and all his 
 around. The note carried a bullet stuck with tape. Dozens of organizations 
 Santa Fe union and policies, the national table of the CCC and the PCR 
 They repudiated this fact, demanding from the different levels of the State the prompt 
 research and protection of the partner and his family, the clarification 
 of the fact and the punishment of those responsible. </p>
<p>This happens a few days after the murder attempt by fellow Lautaro Nahuel 
 Ardura, in La Pampa. They are facts that show that there is a fascist right that 
 Try to hit us, and an enemy state of popular forces. </p>
<p>They also advance in different parts of the country judicial causes against 
 Companions and companions of the CCC and the PCR driven by macrista and 
 others of justice. </p>
<p>The ruling classes use the entire state apparatus -the "legal" and the 
 MAFIOUS- To isolate and attack those who lead the popular struggle. This demands 
 that we continue in the fight fighting the widest unit as expressed with the 
 great solidarity received from these attacks, and lift the guard to 
 guarantee the continuity of popular struggles for bread, land, work and 
 sovereignty. </p>
<p><strong> 8. </strong> <strong> Our goal is the National and Social Liberation Revolution </strong> </p>
<p>At the close of this edition, hundreds of companions of Río Negro and 
 of different parts of the country made the seventh multisectoral march to 
 Hidden lake, repudiating the presence of the English magnate Lewis and reiterating 
 The sovereign claim in that area of our homeland. </p>
<p>On February 1, dozens of organizations, including the CCC and 
 The PTP-PCR, march to the Supreme Court in CABA and the Federal Courts of 
 The whole country demanding the cessation of persecution to social organizations 
 and union, and its leaders. </p>
<p>With the resolutions of the 13 PCR Congress we go to meet the great 
 political debate in the masses around what is the exit in favor 
 from town. </p>
<p>Putting the center to lead the struggles and accumulate revolutionary forces, 
 We propose affiliation to our party and its youth to all the colleagues and 
 Companions with whom we share the daily struggle. </p>
<p>We address that mass discussion with a proposal expressed in our 
 DIEZ PROGRAM MEASURES_. This debate includes the electoral proposals of 
 each district, which are carried out in many provinces, and the national election. 
 But that goes further, because what is at stake is to advance in the unit to 
 the struggle of the popular sectors, on the path of a revolution that
State, in the hands of the working class and the people. </p>

 He could launch a general offensive along the entire front, having to opt 
 for choosing a single objective for a great summer offensive, such a goal 
 I understood the oil fields of the Caucasus mountains that were 
 In the southwest, for this purpose Hitler ordered first to conquer the city of 
 Stalingrad to cement the northern flank. The fascists dispatched 1,500,000 
 soldiers, trying to cut and conquer the supply of 
 Oil of Soviet armies and supply their own strength. TO 
 Stalingrad the Nazi Military High Command sent his best generals, 
 transferring even airplanes and tanks of the North Africa Front, to its 
 more qualified hyenas. However, the Hitler Military High Command continued 
 dreaming of conquering Moscow. With that stratagema fascism played the 
 all for the whole and sought to ensure his future and avoid defeat in the front 
 Oriental. Mao Tse-Tung described the attack against Stalingrad as a 
 offensive "on which the very existence of fascism depended." </p>
<p>For its part, the Bolshevik Communist Party and the High Commands of the Army 
 Red prepared ideological, organizationally and politically, with a plan of the 
 They expected Stalingrad to become the tomb of German fascism. 
 On the new situation on the Stalin War Front, he said- «What 
 It consisted, then, the main objective of the German offensive? It consisted of 
 Wrap Moscow by the East, isolate the capital of the Volga rear to the capital of the rear 
 and of the urales and then attack it. The advance of the Germans in the south, 
 Towards the oil zones, he pursued not only and not so much the objective 
 auxiliary to occupy these, as if to distract south the bulk of our 
 reservations and weaken the Moscow front, to get the 
 success by attacking the capital. This, precisely, explains what the group 
 main of the German troops is now not in the south, but in the 
 Orel and Stalingrad sectors ». With those guidelines the Red Army 
 He had been folding his forces along the Don river organized with 
 The objective of stopping the Nazi advance in Stalingrad. </p>
<p>The plan to stop Nazi advance in Stalingrad was to transform the 
 city in an enormous sponge that absorbed and bass 
 possible of German troops for the time necessary to organize and concentrate 
 secretly a great army and then with a strong 
 Counteroffensive surround, catch and annihilate all the VI German army. The 
 key to the success of that plan was an urban struggle with 
 Guerrillas war characteristics supported by the masses. Chuikov, who 
 The defense of the glorious battle of Stalingrad commanded, considers two 
 Moments in the battle- «It is divided into two periods- the defensive, of the 17 of 
 July to November 19, 1942, and the offensive, of November 19, 1942 
 as of February 2, 1943. The battle lasted six and a half months. In her 
 More than 2 million men and immense participated in both parts 
 amount of war material ». </p>
<h4>Defensive period</h4>
<p>In the defensive period there is a fierce struggle in the vicinity of 
 Stalingrad, in the novel <em>elos fought for his homeland</em> of Mikhail Shologov 
 written in 1942 and in full advance of the Nazi Army made the region of El Don, 
 It is portrayed as with the courage of the Red Army a resistance is exercised 
 Tenaz to German advance in Stalingrad. In those moments the 
 Communist Party, in difficult conditions it organizes in detail the defense 
 from the city creating special units with the thousands of its best 
 militants and in a short time they manage to transform into a military fort 
 Stalingrad. The famous barricada and October factories, together with the 
 power plant, they became military preparations centers. Thousands of 
 Obrero militiamen formed combat units, armed with bracelets and 
 Rifles Veterans of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War, 
 Aceries, railroads and shipyard workers, 
 tractor engineers, Volga barquers, women and men prepared 
 To fight next to the Red Army. Around factories, others 
 workers dug trenches to defend them. During the advance of
crops and digs trenches against tanks. Of the city was achieved 
 Evacuate most of the 500,000 inhabitants across the river. A 
 Burgo historian thus described the first battle in the trenches 
 Around Stalingrad- «overnight, the Russian militia led to 
 carried out a miracle- it dug interconnected fortified positions and assimilated the 
 Basic points of modern war. Now, dressed in your work clothes or 
 elegant Sunday clothes, they snuggled behind the mortars and 
 machine guns to challenge the best army of tanks in the world. When he 
 Combat group [German] Krupen staggered before their artillery barrier, the 
 Russians even started a counterattack, directed by t-34 tanks without painting, 
 that left directly from the assembly lines ». </p>
<p>The German fascists began an air attack on Stalingrad with the 
 intention to reduce it to ashes and bend it, the German bombers Stuka 
 They attacked many boats that transported civilians and released bombs 
 of dispersion in the middle of the crowds that expected transfer. The force 
 Nazi Aérea released thousands and thousands of bombs on the city and left it on fire. 
 Dozens of thousands of civilians died in the initial attacks. The members of 
 The communist youth groups mobilized the population to search 
 collectively survivors among the rubble. Meanwhile, the tanks 
 and Nazi soldiers advanced to the city with the dream of catching the 
 Soviet armies against the river and defeat them there, all in a period of 24 
 hours. </p>
<p>Stalingrad resistance was tenacious, in the heroic anti -aircraft 
 Soviet Chuikov tells us- </p>
<p>«In his eagerness to get as soon as possible to the Volga in an extensive strip, the 
 Fascists did not cease the air bombings of Stalingrad or for a minute- 
 Only August 23 Fascist aviation made two thousand incursions. The 
 Antialean defense soldiers and Soviet pilots rejected with everything 
 courage the successive attacks of Nazi aviation. In a single day, on the 23rd of 
 August, 90 enemy planes knocked down. There were few cases when 
 Air defense soldiers had to fight fighting not only against 
 planes, but also against the tanks and infantry of the enemy, such as 
 It happened in the immediate vicinity of Moscow.(…)Most crew of anti -aircraft and light cannons 
 reflectors were women ... they were firm and continued shooting even when 
 The bombs exploded around them, when it seemed impossible even 
 stay in your position. In the middle of fires and smoke, in the middle of 
 Bombs bursts, apparently regardless of earth columns 
 They jumped into the air everywhere, they were firm until the end. For 
 That, and despite large casualties, German planes always stumbled upon 
 A concentrated fire and suffered many losses. The artilleras lowered dozens 
 of German airplanes above the city ». </p>
<p>The first fascist tanks reached the suburbs on September 1. 
 There the plan is activated and the street struggle that had been planned begins. The 
 city destroyed with its rubble and ruins becomes an ideal land 
 that hinders the advance of German tanks and favors the red army, 
 The German tanks became easy and the first to arrive were 
 destroyed from the ceilings of the buildings in ruins. Chuikov wrote- 
 «We destroy the infantry separately and the tanks that penetrated our 
 Lines- the tanks could not do much without the infantry, and that is why 
 They withdrew after suffering great losses ... in the counterattacks the enemy 
 He always suffered many casualties and had to abandon an attack. Then I had to 
 Tour the front in search of a weak point in our defenses, losing 
 time and initiative ... Many times our purpose was not only to cause them 
 Losses but, through an infantry surprise attack and tanks, and with 
 The help of our artillery and airplanes, penetrate their positions, upset 
 His formations, break his attack and win time ». </p>
<p>In the street fight, Chuikov instructs the red army to apply the 
 tactics of <em>abrazar the enemy</em>, apprehending from the same practice of the 
 fight concludes- «So we realized that we should reduce it to 
 Minimum anyone's land, if possible at the distance of a grenade ». The 
 Soviet soldiers tried to approach the enemy so much with the intention of 
 prevent the fascist air force could bombard the Soviet units 
 of the front and its trenches without risking the lives of German soldiers. In 
 the fierce melee fight that was unleashed, where even the 
 Palas and hand tools sometimes became weapons, morale rose 
 and the intrepidity of the Red Army and declined the moral of the Hitlerians. "Your 
 Moral could not tolerate it. They didn't have enough value to look at
Advanced position from afar, especially during the night, because 
 constantly, every five or ten minutes, he shot his submachine gun. 
 to reinforce his morals. That way our soldiers found those 
 ‘Guerreros’, they approached them quietly and annihilated them with a bullet or 
 bayonet". In that new scenario, the fascist army began to 
 I wear out and all its logic of lightning war lost sustenance, Chuikov 
 Testimony- «Urban war is a special combat class. Things don't 
 They are resolved through force, but for skill, ingenuity and 
 The speed ... The key is the small infantry units and weapons and 
 individual tanks ». </p>
<p>The masses that survived between the rubble became a vital 
 Support for Red Army with the information they provided about the positions 
 of the enemy. Many orphaned children surviving between ruins in 
 occasions became "children of regiments." These children are 
 He wore, they were feed and they were given a military uniform. These with their 
 tiny bodies and their agility were good to cross debris, 
 hide and collect information from the enemy. Anatoli Kúrishev was a "son 
 of the regiment »that participated in the heroic defense of the Pavlov house, where 
 A small group of soldiers for 58 days managed to reject all attacks 
 enemies until the last breath. Anatoli Kúrishev recalls- «The house had 
 great strategic importance for its position in an open site than the 
 It was difficult to access, the soldiers put mines around the house to 
 hinder the arrival to it. Pavlov told me when I was by his side- see 
 Help Voronov, machine gun and do what he tells you ». 
 Anatoli brought bullets and grenades to the soldiers who defended the house and also 
 He attended the civilians who took refuge in the basement of the house. </p>
<p>Many soldiers of these small units had different nationalities, 
 But they fought until the last breath to defend the great socialist country. 
 «In its ranks an honor belongs to the Komsomol M. Panikaja, Marino 
 of the Pacific Ocean. At the end of September he crossed the Volga along with his 
 883 ° Regiment of the 193a Division and defended with his companions of 
 Regiment El Poblado de Krasni Oktiab. When Nazis tanks(¡cuántas
veces ya!)They attacked the positions of the regiment, M. Panikaja launched against 
 They bottles of flammable fluid. It happened that one of his bottles was 
 crossed by a bullet and the inflamed liquid enveloped him instantly in 
 calls. Burning like a torch, Panikaja without losing serenity, jumped from 
 The trench, approached the enemy tank and with the second bottle 
 fire. The young hero gave his life for the sake of the city's defense to 
 shores of the Volga, for the sake of our just cause and of our great homeland ». 
 Chuikov. </p>
<p>Turning the nut and worsening the situation to the Nazi army, 
 The Communist Party began a "sniper movement" between the 
 Fighters of the 62 army. From there the hero of the Soviet Union would arise 
 Vasili Záitsev, previously worker in the city of Kolomna and young shepherd 
 In Los Urales, who deeply expressed his unwavering decision of 
 defend the city- "After the Volga there is no land for us." Quickly 
 Záitsev became the fear of all fascist soldiers in 
 Stalingrad, during the period from November 10 to December 17, 
 1942, fascinated 225 fascist soldiers and officers, including 11 
 snipers Hitlerian military command transfer from the same Berlin to 
 His best shooter - Commander König, head of the Berlin School of 
 snipers—; Záitsev manages to unsubscribe to the best German fascist shooter 
 in a duel that was registered in its military bookseller. <code>1</code> </p>
<p>For September 24, the Germans controlled most of the city 
 at the cost of suffering many casualties. The resistance continued in the districts 
 Industrials of the North. Many of the Soviet reinforcements that arrived in 
 Those days on the other side of the Volga were teenagers from the regions 
 Border of the Soviet Asia, who were instructed on the fight 
 urban and they were endowed with a manual to fight. On October 14, the 
 Germans launched a great offensive, dreaming of being the last. 
 They started with 3000 aircraft bombings, followed by a three attack 
 Infantry divisions and two tanks. On October 30, the 62nd Army 
 Soviet only controlled three small territories along the river, but 
 Anyway the Germans could not defeat him. A tank officer 
 German wrote- «We have fought 15 days to conquer a single house, with 
 mortars, grenades, machine guns and bayonets. The third day was 54 
 German bodies in basements, landing and stairs. The front is 
 a corridor between burned rooms; It is the roof between two floors. The
fires. There are endless noon fights at dusk. From a floor to 
 another, with a face covered with sweat, we attack each other with grenades 
 In the middle of the explosions, the clouds of dust and the smoke ... ask him to 
 any soldier what meant to fight at such a battle. </p>
<p>On November 11, the Germans launched what would be their last offensive; 
 They had to fight for each meter and every brick. On the second day, on the 12th of 
 November, they sold out. </p>
<h4>Offensive period</h4>
<p>The effort and sacrifice of Stalingrad combatants gave time 
 necessary to secretly group a large army of about 1,700,000 
 men. The Hitler High Command had bit the lure. Stalin, the general 
 Vassilevsky and Marshal Zhúkov analyzed the weak points of the enemy 
 fascists and realized that they had neglected the flanks, they 
 They prepared the Oración Uranus Plan, which consisted of a clamp maneuver 
 To fence, cover and embolize the sixth Nazi army entirely, simulating the 
 Lightning war maneuvers, also breaking into the German rear 
 for the two north and south flanks, attacking where the Hitler forces 
 They were weaker. </p>
<p>On November 19, 1942, a powerful attack by Soviet Artillery 
 Announced the beginning of the strong offensive. From the north and south a movement 
 Pinge envelope surrounded 330 thousand Nazi soldiers and officers in just 5 
 days. That offensive was made in the middle of winter, so skill 
 And preparation of red soldiers helped to ensure the fence. </p>
<p>Hitler's response to the VI Army von Paulus army, was that of 
 resist the fence while sending troops and supply to help 
 break it. Hitler sent a large group of tanks under the command of the Marshal 
 Manstein field from the gift to break the fence, while ordering the 
 Nazis air forces supply Paulus. However, the Red Army held 
 Manstein armored divisions in a fierce battle. The novel 
 Yuri Bondariev's burning snow <code>2</code> stage that battle where they were 
 defeated the armored divisions with limited resources and after leaving 
 forcedly for whole days in winter. The Air Force response 
 Nazi was ineffective due to the blows proposed by the Soviet anti -aircraft force. 
 About the German army fenced the pressure of the red army, added to 
 Diseases, hunger and inclement weather. The VI Nazi Army 
 German disintegrated little by little and ended up surrendering on February 2, 
 1943. Paulus surrendered to the 90 thousand soldiers that remained from the VI Army. 
 Stalin when doing an analysis about the result of Stalingrad for 
 Fascists said- «The battle of Stalingrad ended with the fence of a 
 German army of 300,000 men, with its defeat and 
 imprisonment of almost a third of the fenced troops. To occur 
 an idea of the proportions of the unprecedented debacle in history that 
 It took place in the Stalingrad fields, it is necessary to know that after the 
 termination of this battle, the amount of 
 147,200 corpses of German soldiers and officers and 46,700 soldiers and 
 Soviet officers. Stalingrad dizzy the decline of the fascist army 
 German". <code>3</code> </p>
<p>The 90 thousand soldiers made prisoners were forced to work to 
 rebuild the city and then sent to forced labor fields. Of 
 That number only survived 6 thousand who were released by the revisionist 
 Krushev in 1953 after dethroning the dictatorship of the proletariat in the USSR. 
 Years later Krushev changed the name to the city of Stalingrad by the name 
 Current Volgograd, in accordance with their opportunistic and relief interests 
 Of all imperialists, since Stalingrad meant the tomb of fascism 
 German. </p>

<p>With the strike there was a participatory and self -managed by the workers 
 press conference, significantly in front of the ATS headquarters in Trezzo, with 
 Journalists of Milan Today, of the day, those of the Gazzetta della Martesana 
 and of Radio Popolare and some independent ones who carry out investigations on the world

 silence, perhaps recommended by a trade unionist to accept the offer of

<p>Proletarians of all countries, unite!</p>
<p><strong> Unmask the Yankee imperialist plan against Peru and other countries of 
 LATIN AMERICA</strong> </p>
<p>In a context of general crisis of imperialism, mainly for a 
 acute and deep economic crisis. This crisis athes once again 
 fundamental contradictions and the main(imperialismo-naciones oprimidas)Unbeatable, objective conditions to enhance the movements of 
 national liberation and the development of the new great wave commanded by the 
 Maoism and popular wars has given as great and strategic triumph the 
 Conformation and next reunification of the International Communist League Paso 
 decisive and transcendental in the future communist international commanded by 
 Maoism. </p>
<p>We express our fervent communist greeting to the international proletariat, to 
 the communist parties, movements and organizations that make it up and 
 We reaffirm in our almighty scientific and universal ideology 
 Marxism-Leninism-Maoism mainly Maoism, and the decisive contribution and 
 Universal of President Gonzalo our Headquarters for having defined it as 
 third, new and upper stage of Marxism and masterfully apply it to the 
 Peruvian revolution contributing decisively to the new development of the 
 Marxism. </p>
<p>At the international level, inter imperialist contradictions by 
 one side of Yankee imperialism as a unique hegemonic superpower, in 
 decline, his financial oligarchy commanded by the buying bourgeoisie 
 called "neoliberal globalization" is in deep crisis and growing 
 Inflation with a black perspective with tremendous recession, apply each time 
 more protectionism that sharpens their struggles, resort to fascism, risk of 
 "Civil War" and "Separatism" or "Autonomy of States", its plans 
 strategic to maintain your unique hegemonist condition, they are tumbo in 
 tumbo, crisis in crisis and are increasingly based on war blackmail and 
 atomic to intimidate or generate fear in oppressed nations; Wars of 
 aggression and prey(OTAN en medio oriente y ahora en Europa del Este)sponsor 
 and promote "terrorism" depending on their interests. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Russian atomic superpower has been recovering positions and 
 Coligated with social Chinese imperialism they have been developing plans 
 strategic to undermine, prevent and contrast the Yankee hegemonic plans 
 consolidating in their domain areas and expanding their areas of influence 
 Asia case, Africa, and Latin America(considerar que Rusia y China mantienen
influencia y se coluden en regímenes comandados por la burguesía burocrática
pero pugnan para abarcar con mayor amplitud en base a sus propios intereses). </p>
<p>In Latin America, the base of Yankee imperialism, its hegemonic plans in the 
 region are being undermined, the penetration of Russian superpower 
 influencing and politically supporting regimes where the faction 
 bureaucratic commands the bureaucratic landowners cases; Cuba, 
 Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia, etc. Simultaneously social -imperialism 
 Chinese(quien sueña ser superpotencia mundial en el presente siglo)and its 
 Global hegemonic plans has been executing a series of plans and projects 
 In that sense, for example "the so -called new silk route" and from there the 
 voracity with which it is launched on energy resources in the region(hidrocarburos, minería, litio, gran pesca, reservas de agua, etc)under the 
 Mantle of economic and commercial relations. Let's look at the case of our country- 
 64% of Peruvian exports become mining contributing 10% 
 From GDP, Peru is the second world producer in copper and zinc and the third 
 silver and tin producer in Latin America, in addition, we are the first 
 Zinc producer, tin, lead and selenium despite the fact that only 1.07% of 
 Peruvian territory is in mining exploitation and 0.28% is in 
 exploration, that is more than 98%, it will consider as a virgin zone in 
 exploitation, we add to this that the production of copper and silver that the 
 country are necessary for the energy transition process(la sociedad
nacional de minería, petróleo y energía asume que el 16% de la inversión
privada está en la minería). How about cake that the Yankees and their allies 
 They want them alone, but there they step on the heels of Russian superpower 
 And Chinese socialimperialism!We are part of the loot and we cannot consent to it 
 Let's defend the homeland with Popular War!</p>
<p>Acute and intense interimperialist contradictions in the region affects 
 the bosom of the exploitative classes mainly of the great bourgeoisie between 
 His two factions(burguesía compradora y burguesía burocrática)We see too 
 The cases of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil, etc.
September 1992 established the political period to which the 
 democratic revolution, given the growing and greater intervention of the 
 mainly Yankee imperialism with the aim of specifying their 
 antihistoric three counterrevolutionary tasks- reimpulsory capitalism 
 bureaucratic, restructure the old Peruvian state but mainly its 
 dream of annihilating the popular war. </p>
<p>President Gonzalo with great political vision, clear maoist vision that 
 Clean cobwebs sued us to think with a lot of historical sense seeing the 
 History of Peru, let's see the last three centuries and set a clear 
 definition. 18th century- domain of Spain, it led us to deep crisis, 
 consequence Peru was divided. </p>
<p>19th century- Domain of England, in your contest with France? War with 
 Chile. It led us to a deep crisis. We lost territory and our 
 Homeland suffers a schism. </p>
<p>20th century- we have a dominator the Yankee imperialism mainly where 
 has brought us? To the worst crisis in the entire history of the Peruvian people. </p>
<p>Since 1980 with the beginning and development of the Popular War, Peruvian Society 
 contemporary has entered his third moment of general crisis and 
 Mainly he has entered his destruction and border of the three great 
 Mountains that exploit and oppress the people; Imperialism, capitalism 
 bureaucratic and semi -feudality. </p>
<p>Before the development of the popular war and have reached balance 
 strategic as a second political and military stage of the Popular War, in 
 1991 mainly Yankee imperialism and reaction "to maintain its 
 system and recover positions "in defense and safeguard of the State 
 Bureaucratic landowner gave the autogolpe of April 5, 1992(desarrollo de la estrategia contrasubversiva yanqui- desarrollo de la guerra
de baja intensidad)To impose a fascist, genocidal and vendatria regime 
 Proyanqui for decades ahead with long -term plans. </p>
<p>In 1993 as part of its fourth restructuring they prepared(en medio de
genocidio)and approved a political constitution made to measure and in 
 Function of the interests of imperialism mainly Yankee. </p>
<p>This projequi constitution and spine of this regime being 
 Fascist, genocidal and vendatria raised this hidden and bloody 
 constitution of prey to structure the reimpulso of capitalism 
 bureaucratic although it literally declared as a "social economy of 
 Mercado "when in the background they applied a" free market "economy 
 sweeping national production and giving the entry of the 
 imperialist industry, this so -called "neoliberalism" in favor of a greater 
 Mainly imperialist penetration and domain(art 62 o contratos ley como
ejemplo), this reimpulso did not come just with restructuring his device 
 state characterized by presidential absolutism(camarilla
fascista)digitated by the Yankee embassy. Reimpulsory and restructuring was not 
 possible but entered to annihilate the popular war for what is 
 Constitution of 93 promoted and legalized the greatest delivery and greater power with 
 faculties to FF.AA and fascist and genocidal PNPs apply the strategy 
 Low intensity war contrasubversive. </p>
<p>President Gonzalo in the document "Comments about the coup d'etat" 
 He taught us to differentiate what a state system is and told us with 
 clarity that this is a class dictatorship of great bourgeois and 
 landowners at the service of imperialism mainly Yankee and as 
 government system(bajo su forma de democracia representativa)these 
 They differentiated in open and undercover dictatorships. </p>
<p>To the fall of the fascist and genocidal clique of Fujimori and Montesinos in the 
 Year 2000 Mainly Yankee Imperialism I amount to its transition government(Paniagua)Under the auspices of the CIA - OAS, and although it was raised 
 formally change its ragged constitution and that sectors of the great 
 bourgeoisie and opportunism applauded to rage, the economic chapter never 
 They placed in question. </p>
<p>The fascist, genocidal and vendria regime under the hegemony and direction of 
 the buying bourgeoisie in these decades of the present 21st century and 
 accentuated the semi -feudal character(megalatinfundios a costa del despojo de la
tierra del campesinado principalmente pobre y semicolonial )(mayor injerencia,
intervención y dominio imperialista principalmente yanqui)where it develops 
 a rotrefacto bureaucratic capitalism as was the signature of the FTA with 
 USA by Toledo and its implementation with blood and fire with more than 120 decrees 
 Legislative with the genocidal of Alan García and then Captain Carlos or 
 Ollanta Humala. </p>
<p>This Yankee imperialist domain over the old and expired Peruvian state is 
 being undermined by the growing penetration of Russian imperialism and 
 particularly for Chinese socialimperialism, which has a strong impact</p>
<p>tendencias demoliberal y fascista)but mainly impact and forces 
 Forge with popular war the only path that the people have, the way 
 democratic of the people as a popular liberation path, that is the 
 circumstance that we are going through today and is clear that the avant -garde 
 Organized by the proletariat, our Communist Party of Peru directs and 
 will direct until the conquest of power for the proletariat and the 
 Peruvian people, is there another way? That is why we say popular war until 
 Communism!</p>
<p>Since 2016 the struggle within the buying faction between the trend 
 fascist(keiko Fujimori)and the demoliberal trend(PPK)for the control of 
 Executive of the fascist, genocidal regime and salepatria proyanqui became worse, 
 Fujimorismo with the control of the bourgeois Parliament was undermining the 
 Executive, questioning the essence in the conduction of the regime- the 
 Presidentialist absolutism, simultaneously I was taking the other powers and 
 institutions of the old state as shown before the control that 
 have with- Judicial Branch, Public Ministry, Constitutional Court, 
 etc. Following this reactionary path because that is the real 
 reactionary and counterrevolutionary path that corresponds to them to follow, 
 Do they have another way? Well, they don't have it, it is their only way out, continue with a 
 fascist, genocidal regime and venpatria proyanqui and we are seeing it in this 
 present and clear century confirming once again what the 
 President Gonzalo. </p>
<p>At present they conduct the fascist, genocidal and vendate regime to a 
 Permanent political crisis(05 presidente en 05 años)Atized by the crisis 
 international economic and financial(2018 y 2019)And for the deep crisis 
 of bureaucratic capitalism that does not give for more and that have tried to cover up and 
 postpone through its "emergency states and health militarization" 
 Dizque to combat pandemia(Covid - 19)And in the middle of an insulting 
 shameless corruption of great negotiated at the expense of death and life of the 
 town. The Executive next to the cliques of the FF.AA and Police 
 genocides, monopoly pharmaceuticals and private clinics kneaded 
 great fortunes demonstrating that the collapsed public health system 
 It served the population, an abandonment of centuries at the expense of health and 
 life, hunger, misery and malnutrition among others, caused the death of more than 
 200 thousand people. The highest index in the world. Destruction of forces 
 productive(eliminar el excedente poblacional)genocidal and sinister plan 
 This fascist regime and the hegemonic plans of imperialism 
 mainly Yankee. </p>
<p>It is in this context of crisis and decline of the fascist, genocidal regime and 
 traitors(dentro del tercer momento de crisis general y destrucción de la
sociedad peruana contemporánea)that are convened to the general elections of the 
 year 2021, crucial elections for imperialism and reaction in function 
 to continue compliance with its three counterrevolutionary tasks but and 
 very particularly for the fascist tendency(fujimorismo)of the faction 
 buyer who at all costs needed total state control 
 mainly from the Executive. </p>
<p>The 2021 is elected the Rondero and Anticomunista of Pedro Castillo, a 
 OPPORTUNISIST TO CAN TO RABE AND FAIENDER AND DEFENDER OF THE INTEREST OF 
 The bureaucratic bourgeoisie(Perú libre procastrista, feudillo de la familia
cerrón)With the support of a review of revisionists and opportunists 
 particularly from Movadef and those of the VRAEM, that opportunistic line of 
 left of reniego and alstation, whom their shameless dreams of 
 amnesty, capitulation and enlistment have not prevented them from leaving in defense 
 of those who, by mandate of Yankee imperialism, became the executioners 
 executors(Castillo Terrones - Anibal Torres y otros con la venia de la CIA)of the vesanic and furry plan to kill President Gonzalo Honor y Gloria 
 to President Gonzalo the greatest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist who has given the 
 land!. </p>
<p>Since the presidency assumed, Castillo's opportunist rondero, opened 
 a period of intense struggle between both factions; The imperialism 
 Mainly Yankee gave his formal endorsement to this Rondero de Castillo 
 While plotting his overthrow by the buyer bourgeoisie(tendencia fascista representado por el fujimorismo)Under the control of the 
 Cloaca called Parliament and with the Venia de las Ffaa and PNP fascists, 
 genocidal and more projanqui and blessed by the thirsty church of 
 blood. </p>
<p>The tendency to question presidential absolutism in favor of a 
 parliamentary absolutism is aggravated at the end of 2022. Restructuring 
 From the old Peruvian state on the mat again and the bourgeoisie 
 Bureaucratic is the one who promotes the constitutional illusions of an assembly 
 constituent for a new constitution, there are even those who add "to
mainly to recover positions and go to command the direction of the 
 old and rotten Peruvian state, sell to the highest bidder and change the master(promueven siniestras posiciones imperialistas o "plurinacional" "multiétnico"
"etnicidad" "etnocacerismo", "nacionalismo" etc). </p>
<p>On the other hand, the buying bourgeoisie has implemented a defense 
 closed( a sangre y fuego)of the pro -andanqui constitution of 93, formally 
 They could change it but in the essence no, the readjustments that have been executing 
 In this sewer of bourgeois parliament aims to have greater power and control- 
 bicamerality, re -election of congressmen and all kinds of difficulties in 
 Excess of the Executive thus sharpening its contradiction and struggles. </p>
<p>Peruvian people, intense struggle of these bourgeois and reactionary pro 
 imperialists who are framed within a growing wave of protest at level 
 national mainly of the poor peasantry. Long live the heroic struggles 
 Peruvian people!</p>
<p>Being the need for Yankee imperialism and reaction, defense and 
 continuity of their regime on December 7, 2022 they led and executed 
 The coup in favor of a greater intervention of Yankee imperialism, 
 the CIA and the development of its low intensity war and that they have been executing 
 the fascist, genocidal and venopatria armed and police force such as 
 Camarilla and Proyanquis Agents- Dina Boluarte, Otarola, Williams Zapata, Gómez 
 of the tower among other responsible who apply the fascist plan and 
 Yankee genocidal against Peru and the Peruvian people, dream of dismembering, 
 leaving Peru and containing and diverting the revolutionary rise of the 
 mainly poor peasantry, the proletariat and the masses, dream of 
 crush the proletariat and vanguard, the PCP and dream that complicity 
 of revisionism of all kinds and the opportunists will always save their 
 I exposed hunger and misery system. We say; Keep dreaming. </p>
<p>Open dictatorship- a fascist, genocidal regime and vespatria proyanqui that 
 In his eagerness to stay, perpetuate and fulfill the mandates on foot 
 From his master Yankee they have enhancing the genocidal political line of the state 
 Peruvian against the fair and growing popular movement, come 
 developing its yanqui warfing of low war 
 Intensity- militarization of the country through emergency states, 
 curfew, criminalize popular struggles and demands 
 Massive mobilization of their forces, violent admission to universities, 
 Diestra and sinister infiltration in social and popular organizations, 
 In their marches to identify and detain its leaders or representatives, 
 psychological actions against the people through the great media 
 reactionaries and monopolized propaganda and mass communication. The FFAA 
 and FFPP that tried to legitimize before the public opinion showing themselves as 
 "respectful of human rights" and who with the complicity of that "commission of the 
 truth and reconciliation "the main rapist of 
 Human Rights was a path "etc. today is clearly evident that the essence of 
 the armed and police force is a backbone and defender of the old man and 
 Expiue Peruano State Bureaucratic land that falls into pieces; 
 fascists, genocidal, vespatrias proyanqui that sooner rather than later 
 They will receive the fair sanction of the party and town and today the same as yesterday 
 Arbitrary, illegal arrests, torture, disapproves, disabling, disabling, 
 Murders at the police station in the barracks, sabotages to institutions 
 state and private made by themselves through their agents and 
 Lumpenes hired as black heads and shock forces and false 
 Flags and paintings on walls and even murders of your own staff(caso
del policía quemado en su patrullero en puno)to impute them to the population, 
 These FFAA and police, brave to kill but cowards to die, 
 They execute murders of children and mothers for their snipers with the total 
 endorsement and complicity of that caste of hierarchical leaders of the Church as the 
 of Puno, including the death of several newborns before the shrapnel 
 merciler of these genocides against a unarmed civilian population, no 
 happy with that, it has been carrying out villages and cities so that, in 
 The protection of darkness breaks doors and kidnap popular leaders and 
 social as the case of Ayacucho, they continue with gaps to Mansalva and from 
 Artillery helicopters and continue to use their old tactics to face 
 masses against masses and use lumpenes as baits to attract fighters or 
 Identify leaders and then kill them or stop them(lumpenes
venezolanos que muy pronto saldrán huyendo del pais); His "marches for peace" 
 of police, military and intelligence agents(sumados a grupos fascistas,
la resistencia y otros)Police itself promotes it with impudence
torture and violations while with the other hand they pave and sow 
 Tests against premises such as the Peasant Confederation of Peru or again 
 Peru(téngase en cuenta que cuando salió la denuncia de los leeks se supo del
reglaje y seguimiento militar y policial a toda oposición al régimen fascista
y a su constitución proyanqui del 93 imputándoseles de "terrorista"). There is no 
 a single place in the country where they do not show their essence of repression and genocide, 
 what began in the south of the country today travels the national territory. 
 spilled blood will never be forgotten!More more repression, more 
 Genocide plus revolution !!Only the people judge and sanction the genocides!
 Against repression and genocide, for the rights of people and war 
 popular!</p>
<p>They aim to destroy all opposition from social, popular organizations, 
 union and party, etc. But mainly they dream of preventing the progress of the 
 party, which today advances(en sentar sólidas bases)In its general reorganization 
 and the rearrangement of his army today popular liberation. </p>
<p>His counterrevolutionary campaign to impute the people of "terrorists" 
 He is falling loudly, seeks with a vain attempt to separate guerrillas 
 Of the masses, he dreams that the people do not have a fair proletarian direction and 
 Correct, it promotes revisionists and opportunists of any fur to ride in 
 This fair struggles of the heroic town and then "negotiate" at "tables of 
 Dialog 
 system are aiming to stop, kidnap, kill and disappear to 
 true leaders of the people who assume that worthy 
 political and social responsibility. </p>
<p>It is possible that the Peruvian people have a delicious experience in new power and 
 Popular war because it is popular war guided by Marxism-Leninism- 
 Maoism thought Gonzalo and is rooted in class, in the town and that 
 APANICA, frightens reaction and revisionism. </p>
<p>The provisions of President Gonzalo is peremptory- "The class, the people, 
 The masses demand, need, cry out to develop the popular war "and 
 The communists and revolutionaries have a great responsibility for 
 fulfill it. </p>
<p><strong> We live historical moments each must be clear that it is so, 
 Our country has made it part of the imperialist loot sinking into 
 Peruvian people in the worst crisis in all their history !!And, I don't 
 we will allow !!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> President Gonzalo warned us- "Again the nation is at risk, 
 Again the Republic is at risk, the territory is at risk again 
 It can be easily lost and interest. That is the situation to which we 
 they have brought(…)</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Let's think about the danger- that the nation, the country, can be divided, 
 That the nation is at risk want to tear it apart, they want to divide it, who 
 Do you want to do that? The Imperialists, those who exploit, those who send "</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Popular war has shown that the Peruvian State is a paper tiger 
 That is rotten to the tuetano. </strong> </p>
<p>The prolonged popular war led by the party since 1980 has shown and 
 proven allevantly in the eyes of the world and mainly before the 
 Peruvian people that the old Peruvian state is a paper tiger that is 
 rotten to the marrow and only its total, full and complete demolition and 
 Not stone on stone is left. </p>
<p>We live a revolutionary situation in increasing development. Lenin defined 
 as a revolutionary situation(condiciones objetivas de la revolución)and the 
 synthesized in two- 1(régimen fascista,
genocida, vendepatria proyanqui y mayor crisis de su llamada "democracia
representativa")this fragility of the old state and when these 
 contradictions between classes that exercise dictatorship and among their various
imperialist hegemony or undermine each other " </p>
<p>The fragility of the Peruvian State in terms of its state system and system of 
 Government is essential and unsurpassed for this old state for its conditions 
 of the semi -feudal and semicolonial country where an outdated and rotten evolves 
 bureaucratic capitalism, this fragility aggravates compliance with 
 three counterrevolutionary tasks particularly its restructuring(reforma o nueva constitución), his reimpulso that means aggravating the 
 living conditions of the masses and the main thing, face a movement 
 popular in development and in increasing protest that has been generating in this 
 Quinquenio a greater social overflow that seeks to satisfy its most elementary 
 Rights and claims based on the struggle for taking power. </p>
<p>The old Peruvian state sinks and sinks into repression and genocide, 
 in their reactionary violence to maintain your expired system and preserve the 
 interests of exploiters and imperialism but in counterpart this 
 revolutionary violence that as part of history will express very soon 
 yearning for the Peruvian people of a new popular republic of Peru. </p>
<p>For the proletariat and the Peruvian people the problem will be to sweep this or 
 any "new constitution" of the exploiters or other as an expression of the 
 old prevailing order, because none of these represents the most interests 
 Supreme of class and people, it will be by the action of the popular war 
 prolonged that runs the Communist Party of Peru under Marxism- 
 Leninismo-Maoism, Gonzalo Thought to grant a true 
 Constitution and can be achieved in a state of new democracy, at war 
 popular and under the omnimoda direction of the Communist Party of Peru. </p>
<p>Finally, on September 24, 1992, President Gonzalo established which 
 They were the urgent tasks that the party must comply with- <strong> "corresponds 
 that we empower the popular release movement and that we will develop 
 managed at popular war because the people always have been the one who 
 He has defended the country, who has defended the nation in development. 
 It is necessary to form a popular liberation front, it is necessary to form and 
 develop from the popular guerrilla army a popular army of 
 release; That is what corresponds!And we do that!And that 
 We are doing and we are going to do that!You will be witnesses "</strong> </p>
<p>We tell the proletariat and Peruvian people- </p>
<p><strong> Eternal glory to President Gonzalo Chief of the Party and the 
 revolution!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Wow, defend and apply Marxism-Leninism-Maoism thought 
 Gonzalo mainly Gonzalo's thought </strong> </p>
<p><strong> 
 Long live the Communist Party of Peru!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> The popular war will inevitably overcome!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Unite the people against the genocidal fascist dictatorship 
 Proyanqui!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Against repression and genocide!For the rights of the people and the 
 Popular War!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Down the Yankee imperialist plan, fascist and genocidal to destroy the 
 Peru!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Defend the homeland with Popular War!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Develop the popular liberation path with Popular War </strong> </p>
<p><strong> We greet the first Maoist International Conference and the Foundation of 
 The International Communist League Decisive step in the formation of the future 
 Communist International Guided by Maoism!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Long live maoism below revisionism!</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Long live the heroic Peruvian people!</strong> </p>

<p>I wrote about time and water, 
 I described the mourning and its purple metal, 
 I wrote about heaven and apple, 
 Now I write about Stalingrad. </p>
<p>The bride already kept with her handkerchief 
 The ray of my love in love, 
 Now my heart is on the floor, 
 in the smoke and the light of Stalingrad. </p>
<p>I played my hands with my hands 
 of the blue twilight and defeated- 
 Now I play the dawn of life 
 Born with the Sun of Stalingrad. </p>
<p>I know that the old transitory young man 
 of pen, like a bound swan, 
 Uncommonds your notorious pain 
 For my shout of love to Stalingrad. </p>
<p>I put my soul where I want. 
 And I don't get tired of paper, 
 Ink and inkwell. 
 I was born to sing Stalingrad. </p>

 Against your own crushed walls, 
 My voice sounded like bell and wind 
 Looking at you, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>Now American combatants 
 White and dark like grenades, 
 They kill the snake in the desert. 
 You are no longer alone, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>France returns to the old barricades 
 With raised fury pavilion 
 About freshly dried tears. 
 You are no longer alone, Stalingrad. </p>

 Flying on the hurricane sea 
 They nail the claws into the land brown. 
 You are no longer alone, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>Today under your mountains of lesson 
 Not only are yours buried- 
 trembling is the meat of the dead 
 They touched your forehead, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>Undoing the invading hands, 
 crushed the soldier's eyes, 
 Shoes are full of blood 
 They stepped on your door, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>Your blue steel of pride built, 
 Your hair from crowned planets, 
 Your scratch of divided bread, 
 Your bleak border, Stalingrad. </p>
<p>Your homeland and laurels, 
 Blood on your snowy splendor,

 Woven with your blood, Stalingrad. </p>

advantage of concerns in working class communities</em>.’</p>
<p>What solutions have you ever offered the working class in relation to the
artificially created housing crisis, soaring energy prices, the capitalist
rise in cost of living, the lack of jobs, training and education
opportunities, the deliberate destruction of our health and public services,
the decades of deliberate neglect and marginalisation by the state, the
partition and occupation of our country by foreign imperialist powers(the
real foreign threat), the changing of the balance of power from the golden
circle to the people?</p>
<p>You call yourselves patriots. What role have you played in the ongoing
struggle for National Liberation in our country? You know, the one where real
patriots have sacrificed their lives and their liberty for the freedom of
Ireland and the working class?</p>
<p>We know what your leaders have done. Justin Barrett and James Reynolds were in
Fine Gael, the Blueshirts, the anti-Republican party that has been in the
pocket of British Imperialism since 1922. Some patriots. And Hermann Kelly was
being educated in a university well known for links with MI5, before becoming
the lap-dog of Nigel Farage and the most aggressive form of British
imperialism and chauvinism. Maybe we misunderstood. When you call yourselves
‘patriots’ is it British patriots you mean? Again, no friends of the working
class.</p>
<p>As British patriots, is that why Free State fascist organisations are
consistently developing closer and closer links with loyalist death squads and
the British far right? The same death squads that kill innocent Irish citizens
on behalf of British imperialism and the same British far-right that ran
campaigns of hate against Irish immigrants under the banner ‘No blacks, no
dogs, no Irish!’ Are you being directed by MI5 to develop these links and act
in alliance against Irish National Liberation? Justin and Hermann certainly
have form.</p>
<p>Understanding that Irish people, due to 850 years of ongoing oppression, have
a long history of emigration, where our people have suffered racism, violence
and exploitation; Why protest against centres housing vulnerable asylum
seekers fleeing war-torn and destitute countries, seeking international
protection, instead of against those who are really creating the problems,
namely the Free State administration, British, European and US Imperialism,
NATO, the capitalist class and in particular landlords? Is it because you are
in fact in alliance with these same powers and view yourselves very much as
part of their club?</p>
<p>No answers? We thought so.</p>
<p>Fascists have nothing to offer the working class. They are pro-establishment,
pro-imperialist, pro-landlord and have no base in our communities. We won’t
let them get one now.</p>
<p>The Irish people have always been proudly anti-imperialist and anti-fascist.
Let us be proud of that tradition and not allow our fighting spirit to be
hijacked by far-right lies online or the fascist boot boys serving the agenda
of those in power.</p>
<p>Full consultation with the community when asylum seekers and refugees are to
be housed in an area is a must!No more lies. Information takes away fear and
consultation, information and communication will lead to genuine integration.
Resourcing is needed in all communities where asylum seekers and refugees are
to be housed. Housing for all, training and education opportunities, funding
for schools, sports clubs, healthcare and other community services are a must
and are a legitimate set of demands from working class communities.</p>
<p>Working class communities have genuine concerns. Anger at the cost of living,
the housing crisis, the collapse of our healthcare system and being ignored by
those in power for generations have led to anger coming to boiling point. But
that anger must be channeled in the right way. Our communities won’t be fixed
by targeting vulnerable asylum seekers, refugees or migrants and that only
serves the agenda of those in power as a distraction from the real issues.</p>
<p>The working class need a united front to fight against our exploitation by
those in power. The anger and protests need to be directed at those in
Leinster House, and Stormont, against the multinationals and international
imperialism. Against the landlords, the energy companies, the fascists and the
far right agitators. Building such a movement is the task for all of us who
believe in an Ireland owned and controlled by the people, in the Republic
proclaimed in 1916.</p>
<p>And remember, if anyone is calling for protests against asylum seekers or
scapegoating refugees or migrants, they are serving the interests of those in
power and should be isolated and unwelcome in our communities. Let’s focus on
our real enemies and not allow ourselves to be divided and conquered by those
in power!</p>

<p><em>In the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union a 
 Stalingrad on the Nazi -fascist invaders</em> </p>
<p>At the beginning of the winter 1942-1943 it opened on the banks of the Volga and Don one 
 New stage of the mortal struggle against Nazifascism, entry into history 
 like the period of the radical turning point throughout the second war 
 world. The main merit of the realization of this turning point in favor 
 of the anti -fascist coalition belongs to the Soviet Union. 
 In the avid battles of 1942-1943 on the Soviet-German front yes 
 the historical destinies not only of the Soviet people decided, but of the whole 
 humanity. </p>
<p><strong> 1 . The defeat of the fascist troops on the Volga. The beginning of the turning point 
 radical in the war </strong> </p>
<p>The situation at the beginning of the counter -offensive of Soviet troops on 
 Southern </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 the Soviet-German front, with the exception of some sectors, 
 He stabilized throughout the line from the sea of Barents on the slopes of the Caucasus. 
 However, the situation continued to be extremely serious for the union 
 Soviet. Leningrad was besieged, great enemy forces continued to 
 operate on the distant access routes to Moscow, the incessant rough 
 Stalingrad fights always absorbed new forces, the main streets 
 of communication with the Caucasus were interrupted. </p>
<p>The situation on the seas was also unfavorable for the Soviet armed forces. 
 The Baltic fleet was blocked in the eastern part of the Gulf of 
 Finland. The Black Sea fleet, after the loss of the Crimea peninsula e 
 of ninotorossijsk, he was forced to lead to inadequate ports such as those of 
 Poti, Gelendžik and Tuapse, and this hindered his actions. In more conditions 
 The North fleet was favorable. Reinforced with ships made 
 from the Pacific Ocean, it defended northern communications and 
 He lent a valid help to terrestrial troops in the defense of the coast. </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 it became clear that the plans of the summer-autumn campaign 
 of the Nazi command had failed. Although the German troops and theirs 
 allies had arrived on the Volga and were on the slopes of the Caucasus, 
 They had not achieved their main objective. The advance 
 of the summer, about a million men had cost the Nazi Germany between 
 killed, injured and prisoners as well as the loss of a huge amount of 
 means and armaments. </p>
<p>The German Armies group "A", having met an avid resistance 
 by the Soviet troops on the slopes of the Caucasus, he was busy 
 in long and exhausting fights. The "B" Army Group had to get used to 
 On a headquarters of the length of 1,300 km. In the center of the arch, of 
 In front of Stalingrado, there were the VI armed by Von Paulus and the IV Army 
 Hath's battleship, which fought for the conquest of the city. To theirs 
 wings were lined up by the III and the IV Romanian armies and the VIII Italian Army, 
 Go to the defensive. The satellite troops were weaker from the point of 
 Military and moral view of the German ones. </p>
<p>The situation of the troops of the fascist attackers who were under 
 Stalingrado and in the North Caucasus was aggravated by the fact that their reserves 
 strategic were almost completely exhausted. On the boundless forehead 
 Eastern, which extended for over 6,000 km, there were in the reserve of 
 central command of German terrestrial troops only three divisions 
 battleships, a spare division and two infantry brigades; in the reserve 
 There were eight divisions of the armed groups and a brigade. </p>
<p>In October 1942 the German command, considering the situation compromised, 
 He made the decision to move on to the defensive. In order n. 1 of 14 October 
 1942 was arranged- "We have to face the winter campaign. The task of 
 Eastern front - in addition to the current offensive operations or designed 
 - is to keep the positions achieved at any cost, reject each 
 attempt by the enemy to break them through and thus create the conditions for 
 continue our offensive in 1943 in order to defeat 
 definitively our most dangerous enemy ". </p>
<p>On the basis of these provisions, the German armed forces began i 
 preparations for the winter. On the entire length of the front they were built 
 or strengthen the fortifications. 
 Particular attention was paid to the central front of the front, where 
 The Wehrmacht command was expected offensive actions of the red army. 
 Here the main reinforcements to detrose the groupings were concentrated 
 of the other areas. At the beginning of the winter campaign, in the group of armies
to which the Germans placed on the eastern front. The Hitler General Staff 
 he believed that the offensive of the red army against the group of armies 
 central would have been launched at the beginning of November. </p>
<p>For its part, the Soviet supreme command, in perfecting the plans 
 of the winter offensive, had decided to launch the main blow in the 
 Southern sector with the forces of the south-west front(comandate dal tenente-
generale Vatutin), of the Don front(comandate dal tenente-genera­le
Rokossovski)and the Stalingrad front(comandate dal colonnello-generale
Eremenko)starting from the Stalingrado area with a single direction to the 
 Basin of the Don. To prepare the counter -offensive and coordinate the actions of 
 Fronti were sent to the Stalingrad area the general of the army Zukov e 
 The Colonellogeneral Vassilevski. </p>
<p>The opportunity to start the attack in this sector was dictated by 
 A set of political, economic and military factors. The decisive defeat 
 of the enemy in the South had to lead to the definitive collapse of his plans that 
 they focused on the arrival of the German troops in the Caucasus and the entrance of the 
 Turkey in the war against the Soviet Union. Obtaining decisive results 
 soldiers in the South, the very rich cereal areas of the 
 Don and Kuban, the conditions for the liberation of the 
 Basin of the Don, and the enemy threat to the sources of 
 oil of the Caucasus and the communication routes with the allies that 
 Through Iran they reached the Persian Gulf. The Don Basin sector 
 The most vulnerable point in German strategic defense appeared. </p>
<p>With the arrival of the Soviet troops in Rostov the conditions for 
 The defeat of the German armored group "A", which operated in the Caucasus 
 northern. The defeat of the enemy in the territory between the Volga and the Don 
 It was only to be the first stage of the winter campaign. After success 
 of this operation the Soviet Supreme Command calculated to perform one 
 series of offensive operations on other fronts. Particular importance 
 was given to the elimination of the siege of Leningrado and the defeat of the 
 grouping of the enemy in the areas of Demjansk, Ržev-Vjazma, in the course 
 Superior of the Don and in the northern Caucasus. </p>
<p>The first phase of the winter campaign was designed in the most complete way 
 It is accurate. With the joint efforts of the General Staff of the Command 
 supreme, of the general staff and the command of the fronts of 
 Stalingrado, Del Don and South-West, a plan was developed that received the 
 Name of "Uranus". This plan was based on a very bold idea- with the 
 forces of the three fronts surround and destroy the great grouping of 
 Fascist troops in the territory between the Volga and Don and create the conditions 
 For the passage of the Soviet Armed Forces to the strategic offensive 
 general on the southern wing and on the other sectors of the Soviet front- 
 German. The assault groups of the south-west front and the front of 
 Stalingrad they had to attack by converging on Kalač and Sovjetskij and then tighten 
 In this area the ring of the bag where the troops of the 
 attackers. 
 The defense of the enemy had to be broken in the most vulnerable sectors, which 
 They were held by the Romanian troops. </p>
<p>The beginning of the offensive was set for the south-west fronts of the Don at 19 
 November, for the Stalingrad front to the next day. To implement the 
 "Uranus operation" was needed a huge organizational activity to put the 
 Troops in full efficiency in view of the fighting. It was necessary 
 First of all strengthen the fronts with men, weapons, military vehicles and 
 provisions; Create operational and strategic reserves; perfect the 
 political-military preparation of troops; to secret i 
 assault groupings in the starting areas of the operation; organize 
 their coordination and their direction. The preparations were complicated 
 from the fact that the transport of men and means took place under the 
 continuous bombing from the air on three unique railways, a fact that 
 He limited the speed of influx. A particular difficulty in guaranteeing the 
 secrecy of the concentration of forces was represented by the character 
 mainly stepping of the areas where the next one would have launched 
 offensive. </p>
<p>The success of the operations depended primarily on the actions of the 
 battleship and mechanized units. Therefore, on the eve of the offensive the fronts 
 they were strengthened with units and warts of tanks. Overall in 
 Three fronts about 900 tanks were aligned. Over 13,500 cannons e 
 Mortai were made available to artillery, twice as many as those 
 They had been employed in the counter -offensive of Moscow. The aviation counted more 
 of 1,000 airplanes. </p>
<p>On the eve of the offensive Soviet troops lined up on the three fronts do not
the skilled dislocation of the forces and vehicles in the directors of the attacks 
 main, the Soviet command managed to create powerful blocks of troops. 
 All these forces and means were previously lined up on the positions 
 attack thanks to the work organized in the rear. </p>
<p>On the Volga, from Saratov to Astrachan, 50 worked 50 
 Steam ferries. Numerous boats bridges were built. The 
 concentration of the forces passed unnoticed by the enemy- the divisions in 
 march maintained the most absolute radio silence, all orders 
 they were given to voice. Measures were also widely used for 
 disorient the enemy. Great help offered the military commands the 
 population and organizations of the Communist Party of the Region of 
 Stalingrado. The workers of the Region contributed to the refueling of 
 Troops with food and ammunition. Tens of thousands of citizens worked on the 
 construction of airports, bridges on rivers and roads, helped transport the 
 ammunition and to repair military vehicles. In mid -November i 
 Preparations for the "Uranus operation" had been completed. The red army 
 She was ready to inflict the decisive blow to the enemy. </p>
<p>The encirclement and defeat of German forces in Stalingrado </p>
<p>On November 19, at 8.50 in the morning, after a massive bombing of the 
 artillery, the troops of the south-west fronts and don triggered 
 to the offensive. </p>
<p>An intense snowfall and the morning fog prevented the intervention 
 aviation. After breaking the resistance of the Romanian troops of the 
 III Army, the assault group of the south-west front managed to 
 advance at the end of the first day of fights of 30-35 km. 
 At the same time they penetrated deeply in the enemy defensive device 
 also the troops of the Don front. From the morning of November 20, in conditions 
 unfavorable meteorological, the Stalingrad front passed to the attack. After 
 having broken the defense of the Romanian army south of the city, the troops 
 Soviets went north-west and south-west. </p>
<p>The German command made desperate efforts to arrest the offensive of the 
 Soviet troops, but all attempts to block it or even just 
 slowing it down completely. The mobile units of the south-west fronts and of 
 Stalingrado advanced quickly they reached the wings of the German VI army, 
 Making the threat of lighter weigh on the enemy grouping. </p>
<p>On November 23, the 4th Soviet armored body of the south-west front al 
 command of the major-general A. Kravčenko joined as foreseen in the 
 area of the village of Sovjetskij with the 4th mechanized body of the front of 
 Stalingrado commanded by the major-general V.T. Volski, making it so 
 the encirclement of a large group of enemy strong of 22 
 Divisions. Of the moving units of the two fronts. </p>
<p>In order not to allow the ring to break by the grouping 
 surrounded or its release from the outside, the Soviet troops continued 
 the advance to expand the corridor established between the German troops in the 
 First phase of the operation. Successfully rejecting the counterattacks of the 
 enemy, they arrived on the evening of November 30 on the line of the FUUs Čir and Don. 
 In the meantime, active shares were also conducted on the internal front 
 lighter. On the evening of 30 November the surface occupied by 
 surrounded grouping had already reduced more than half and did not exceed 
 By now 1,500 sq km. This sector was massively hammered by the fire 
 of Soviet artillery. </p>
<p>On November 22, even before the encirclement was completed, the 
 commander of the GENCE VI General Army von Paulus summoned Gumrak la 
 meeting of the commanders of the bodies, who unanimously came to the 
 conclusion that a long defensive struggle within the gigantic bag 
 would lead to the catastrophe and that to avoid it it was necessary to go 
 immediately with the bulk of the forces south-west. General von 
 Paulus asked Hitler for authorization to break the encirclement south 
 west, but obtained an inflexible refusal accompanied by the promise that 
 All measures would have been taken to ensure normal refueling 
 of the Army and at the same time free it from lighter. </p>
<p>At the end of November and in the first days of December the Germans made a 
 First attempt to free the surrounded divisions, launching a counterattack 
 in the area of the southwest front. But the advance of the German wagons was blocked 
 And rejected. </p>
<p>In an attempt to restore the situation in the South, the German command decided 
 to quickly create a new group of "Don" armies, in which they were 
 including troops operating in the great Ansa of Don, together with the group 
 of armies surrounded in the Stalingrado area.
assigned the task of arresting the offensive of Soviet troops and, 
 attacking from the areas of Kotelnikovo and Torre to Stalingrado, of 
 reach the surrounded troops, join them and restore the previous one 
 defense front. The refueling of the surrounded grouping would have been 
 insured by air. </p>
<p>The Soviet command promptly sensed the enemy's plans and prepared 
 effectively to reject its counterattacks- he strengthened his own 
 groupings that operated on the external front of the "corridor", organized the 
 Hunt against enemy transport aviation. In December they were destroyed 
 In the air or at airports over 750 German transport planes. 
 The annihilation of Von Paulus' army was entrusted to the Don front, 
 commanded by the Rokossovski Lieutenant-General. The General Staff of the Command 
 Supreme was represented by the Colonel-General Voronov. However the 
 realization of this goal had to be provisionally postponed. </p>
<p>On 12 December from the district of Kotelnikovo, along the Tichoreck railway 
 Stalingrado, began to advance the 57th armored body of the armed group 
 Hoth. Under the strong pressure of the predominant enemy forces, the army 
 of the Stalingrad front, which operated on this line, was forced to 
 retire north-east. However, on December 15 he managed to arrest 
 the German advance and in the following days heroically resisted the 
 pressure of the enemy. On 19 December the Hath Army Group resumed 
 the offensive and on 23 December reached the Flume Myškova, at a distance of 
 About 40 km from the troops of the VI Army surrounded. </p>
<p>To reject the enemy offensive, it was sent to the Kotelnikovo area 
 The Army of the Guard commanded by the Lieutenant-General Rodion Malinovski, 
 previously intended for the liquidation of the enemy grouping 
 surrounded. In the harsh conditions of Russian winter the troops of Malinovski 
 they went with a forced march of 40-50 km per day to the river 
 Myškova, where the enemy tried to expand his bridge head. As soon as 
 Arriving in contact with the enemy the Soviet army attacked him with a momentum 
 without stopping. </p>
<p>On December 24, the Malinovski army passed to the offensive with an action 
 coordinated with a part of the forces of the V -armed assault and the LI 
 Army. 
 After breaking the German resistance, Soviet troops occupied the 
 December 29 Kotelnikovo. The goal of preventing the 
 New attempt by the enemy to unlock the army of Von Paulus, closed 
 irremediably in the stingrado bag, which now appeared condemned 
 without escape to total destruction. </p>
<p>The troops of the fronts of Voronež and of 
 southwest. On the morning of December 16, after an hour and a half of fire of 
 artillery, the troops of the fronts of Voronež and south-west broke the 
 defense of the enemy in some points and on the evening of December 24 they had 
 made an advance of 100-200 kilometers. In eight days of hard 
 fights they influence a severe defeat to the Italian eighth army e 
 to the left wing of the group of "Don" armies, thus creating a threat of 
 deep encirclement from the north of the bulk of his strength. </p>
<p>On 30 December Soviet troops advanced deeply in the rear 
 of the enemy on the Nikolskaja-Ilinka line. In an attempt to arrest 
 The advance of the fronts of Voronež and south-west, the German command was 
 forced to hurry 8 divisions previously intended 
 At the release of the troops of Von Paulus. At the beginning of January 1943 the 
 Situation of the troops closed in the bag greatly worse. The ring 
 of the lighter narrowed more and more. The Germans were missing reserves 
 of any kind. The ammunition and fuel were about to end. THE 
 moral of the surrounded troops was very low even if the soldiers continued 
 to fight. </p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid a useless bloodshed on January 8, 1943 
 The Soviet command offered the surrender to Von Paulus with the honor of arms, 
 proposing to cease the senseless resistance. Always hoping for the arrival 
 of the "rescue" army and in obedience under the orders of Hitler, von Paulus 
 He rejected the generous offer. On January 10, 1943 the troops of the Don front 
 They then moved on to the annihilation of the surrounded grouping. </p>
<p>Exceeding the strong resistance of the enemy, the troops of the front came on the 17th 
 January in Voroponovo; The Soviet command proposed again to Von Paulus di 
 give up. But this proposal was also rejected. </p>
<p>The troops of the Don front continued the attacks and on January 25 the 
 Soviet avant -garde arrived in Stalingrad from the West. In the evening of 26 
 January the troops of the XXI Army joined the hill area 
 of Mamai to the troops of the LXII Army, thus breaking the
Many soldiers began to surrender. </p>
<p>On January 31, the resistance of the group was definitively broken 
 southern and on February 2 that of the northern part of the Army of 
 von Paulus. </p>
<p>The troops of the Don front had annihilated 22 divisions, doing 
 Prisoners 91 thousand between soldiers and officers with the same marshal von 
 Paulus(Hitler lo aveva promosso sul campo sperando così di indurlo a non
arren­dersi e a sacrificare fino all'ultimo i suoi sol­dati)and conquering 
 A large amount of weapons and military means. During the offensive, 
 Duration two and a half months, 5 armed armed were disfigured 
 fascists. The losses in men of the German troops and allies exceeded, from 
 November 19, 1942 to February 2, 1943, 800 thousand men. During the same period 
 The red army destroyed or captured 2,000 tanks and self -propelled cannons, 
 over 10 thousand cannons and mortars, 2,000 combat and transport planes, 
 Over 70 thousand vehicles. </p>
<p>The general offensive of the Red Army in winter 1942-1943 </p>
<p>The victory over the Volga decidedly borrowed the strategic situation on the whole 
 Soviet-German and first of all in its southern sector. The 
 Soviet supreme command decided, making new forces enter into action 
 expand the front of the strategic offensive. The development of the 
 counter -offensive in general offensive began even before the complete 
 annihilation of the German grouping surrounded on the Volga. 
 Overall, for the general offensive of the winter campaign 1942-1943, 
 Over 70% of all forces and means of the army was used 
 Soviet fighter. The strategic offensive developed on a front of 
 3,000 km and for a depth of 600-700 km. </p>
<p>Thus began the expulsion of the occupants from the Soviet territory. The 
 General Staff of the Soviet Supreme Command approved the offensive plan 
 of the troops of the south fronts and the Caucasus, with the aim of surrounding e 
 Destroy the German grouping that operated on the Caucasian front. In 
 based on this plan, the troops of the south front, in command of the colonel- 
 General Eremenko had to take to the Rostov area and cut the street 
 of the retreat to the North-Caucasian grouping of the Wehrmacht. </p>
<p>The left wing of this front had to attack towards Tichoreck through 
 the steppes of Salsk, so as not to allow the retreat of the enemy towards the 
 Taman peninsula. The troops of the Caucasus front, in command of the general 
 armed I. Tjulenev, they had to attack with the forces of the Mar Group 
 Black to Krasnodar and further on Tichoreck, and, together with the troops 
 of the south front, surround the group of the grouping in this area 
 North-Caucasian German. </p>
<p>At the same time, he was ordered to the northern group of the troops of the 
 front of the Caucasus to push, advanced with his right wing 
 Through Mozdok in the direction of Armavir, the bulk of the I Armored Army 
 German towards the slopes of the Caucasian central chain and then 
 destroy it. </p>
<p>On January 1, 1943, the troops of the south front passed to the execution of the 
 plan. When, after passing the strong resistance of the enemy, they 
 They arrived at the Manyč river, the group of German armies "a" found himself closed in 
 a deep bag, and, in order not to be isolated, began to retire 
 Quickly towards Rostov. </p>
<p>On January 3, the northern group of troops of the Caucasian front 
 The chasing of the retreating units of the I Armored Army began 
 German. However, the rhythm of its advance was insufficient. After 
 northern group, the advance group of the Black Sea also began which 
 operated in the difficult conditions of winter in the mountains, without being able to 
 count, due to bad weather, on the approval of aviation. In January, 
 overcoming the resistance of the enemy and the mountains, the troops of this 
 Group freed Nalčik, Stavropol, Armavir and numerous other locations. </p>
<p>A great help to the troops gave the partisans of Stavropolle direct, from 
 Party Committee of the Region. The patriots attacked the Hitlerians, 
 they destroyed or seized their means, bridges, deposits, 
 locomotives, wagons, also freeing several locations. The group 
 northern of the troops of the Caucasus front, under the command of the lieutenant 
 General I. I. Maslennikov, entered action on January 24, 1943 on the front of 
 Caucasus of the North. </p>
<p>Overcoming the resistance of the enemy, the impracticability of the places and the 
 Bad weather, the troops reached the sea of Azov in early February. In the 
 head of the Kuban bridge, the XVII German army was isolated, which he could now 
 maintain connections with the bulk of the Nazi forces only 
 through Crimea. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the armies of the South front fought in the surroundings of Rostov. A 
 remarkable part of the northern Caucasus was freed, but it was not possible to
With the arrival, at the end of January 1943, of Soviet troops nearby 
 of Rostov, the enemy's resistance increased. The German command appeared 
 desperate efforts to earn the time necessary for the withdrawal of 
 own forces from the Caucasus of the North. Avid fights took place in the 
 area of the Bataisk railway station, 10 km from Rostov, through the 
 Which Germans transported men and means. </p>
<p>The offensive of the troops of the Black Sea Group also developed. The 4 
 February they arrived at the Kuban river and near Krasnodar. For<br />
 take possession of ninational and the Taman peninsula, on the night of 4 
 February the command of the front of the Caucasus of the North and the fleet of the Mar 
 Nero went on to implement a great landing operation in the Jušnaja area 
 Osereika. However, welcomed by the strong fire of the enemy and having immediately strong 
 leaks, a part of the landing ships was forced to retire, while the 
 Troops already landed were unable to keep the head of the bridge because 
 of the inequality of forces. </p>
<p>The result of the landing of the reinforcement troops was more favorable, in command 
 of Major Z. L. Kunikov, in the area of the village of Stanička and the mountain 
 Myšako, near Novorossijsk. This shipment consisting of 800 men 
 of the Marina infantry, quickly reinforced with other departments, occupied and 
 He firmly kept a small bridge head. </p>
<p>The Hitler's Friendly Staff, including the danger that looked out on the 
 Grouping of Nincoossijsk, he gave order to drive at any cost in 
 Soviet soldiers. Against modest Soviet troops they were 
 concentrated the effective of 5 German divisions. </p>
<p>However, their efforts coated against the value of the infantry from Marina 
 Soviet. A struggle began that had to last seven months in the head of 
 Myšako bridge, which was called "small land". For all of this 
 period never ceased fighting with the enemy who used wagons 
 armed, artillery and aviation. </p>
<p>The defenders of the "little land" covered themselves with glory, writing a pages 
 of authentic heroism in the history of the great patriotic war. Troops 
 Krasnot and, on February 12, on February 12, 
 facing bitter fighting, they continued the advance along the banks of the 
 Kuban and the Western Caucasus towards the Taman peninsula. Meanwhile the 
 Troops of the south front attacked the enemy lines in front of Rostov. In the 
 Axis of the city a fierce battle developed. </p>
<p>On February 14, after a few days of harsh fights, Rostov came 
 freed. Following the offensive, the regions of the Ceceno- were freed 
 Inguscezia, of northern obvious, of the Cabardino-Balcaria, the 
 territory of Stavropol, and a large part of the region of Rostov and the 
 territory of Krasnodar. In these regions they lived before the war 10 
 million of people. The German invaders brought enormous damage 
 The economy of the area killed many thousands of Soviet citizens. In the 
 Only territory of Stavropol, they made themselves responsible for the massacre, of over 30 
 thousand civilians </p>
<p>Simultaneously with the offensive of the Soviet troops of the North Caucasus 
 Offensive operations were launched in the Ostrogožsk-Rossošk areas, e 
 Voronež-Kestornoje. </p>
<p>In the second half of January 1943 the troops of the Voronež front, al 
 command of the Lieutenant-General F. I. Golikov, surrounded and destroyed a 
 Strong enemy grouping attested on the Don between Voronež and Kantamirovka. </p>
<p>The main blow was inflicted on the II Hungarian army and the VIII Army 
 Italian, located in this area. During the operations they were 
 Over 15 divisions completely destroyed, while 6 divisions came 
 severely affected. Over 86 thousand between soldiers and enemy officers were made 
 prisoners. 
 Soviet troops advanced 140 km towards Flume Oskol. </p>
<p>Then the troops of the right wing of the Voronež front and the left wing of the 
 front of Brjansk attacked and defeated the grouping in Kastornoje 
 Enemy of the Voronež-Kastornoje line. Only a few groups of soldiers 
 they managed to escape the lighter. During this operation they came 
 11 enemy divisions destroyed. The troops of the fronts of Brjansk and Voronež 
 they freed a large part of the regions of Voronež of Kursk, the cities of 
 Voronež, Kastornoje, Staryi Oskol and Tim. </p>
<p>In these two operations in the upper course of the Don the Group of Armies 
 German "B" suffered a tough defeat. Very serious losses suffered the armies 
 of the satellites of Germany(Ungheria e Italia)The II Hungarian army was of 
 Destroyed fact, having lost 135 thousand men. The same fate touched the eighth 
 Italian Army. Having completely lost the combative ability, it 
 It was withdrawn from the Soviet-German front. The defeat of the armies 
 Hungarian and Italian produced a strong impression in Hungary and Italy e
Satellite countries of Germany. </p>
<p>Developing their offensive, Soviet troops occupied on February 8th 
 Kursk and February 16 Charkov. In the meantime, the troops of the south-west front, 
 At the command of the Colonellogeneral Vatutin, they launched an attack towards 
 Mariupol, to cut the retreat west to the enemy grouping of 
 Basin of the Don. </p>
<p>The partial withdrawal of enemy troops from the lower course of the Don Verso 
 Mius and the movements made by the Germans in the Donec basin were 
 erroneously evaluated by the command of the south-west fronts and by Voronež as 
 The beginning of a general retreat of fascist troops beyond the Dnepr. The 
 General Staff of the Supreme Command agreed with this evaluation. In such 
 way, despite the troops of these fronts had been weakened and had 
 urgent need for reinforcements, their offensive was forced in all 
 Maniere. For its part, the Nazi command designed a great counter -offensive 
 in this sector. </p>
<p>On February 13, the German armored group "Don" was transformed into a group 
 of "south" armies, which was hastily strengthened with units made 
 from Western Europe, from the Balkans, and other sectors of the front 
 Soviet-German. A meeting was held in Zaporžje in the presence of Hitler 
 of the supreme command of the Wehrmacht. The plan was approved in the meeting 
 of the counter-offensive, which provided for the attack on the troops of the southern front 
 West, marching towards the Dnepr, to reject them beyond the northern Don. 
 The plan also involved the encirclement of Soviet troops in the area 
 by Charkov, and, after their defeat, the penetration into the rear of the 
 Front of Voronež and an advance towards Kursk. </p>
<p>At the same time from the area south of ORël he had to start an offensive 
 Against the rear of the Soviet central front, to surround the troops 
 of the red army concentrated in the Kursk area. On the eve of 
 Operations The "South" German Armies Group had 31 divisions, 13 
 of which were battleship or motorized, that is, half of all units 
 Furniture operating on the Soviet-German front. To truth, the divisions 
 Nazi, especially the battleships, were incomplete in men and in 
 means. </p>
<p>The counter-offensive against the right wing of the south-west front began on the 19th 
 February. Under the pressure of the predominant enemy forces the troops 
 Soviet were forced to retire to northern Donec. 
 Subsequently the German units attack the advanced troops of the wing 
 left of the Voronež front. Soviet troops bravely drew up 
 every palm of soil. On these days he received the baptism of fire 
 On Voronež front the Czechoslovak battalion in command of the Colonel 
 Ludvik Svoboda. </p>
<p>On March 13, the Germans occupied Charkov again and rejected the troops 
 of the left wing of the Voronež front towards Belgorod creating a situation 
 difficult not only for this front, but also for the rear of the front 
 central. The major staff of the Soviet supreme command then moved towards 
 The areas threatened the reserves with which, towards the end of March, it came 
 The German counter -offensive arrested. On the whole southern wing of the front 
 Soviet-German from Belgorod to the sea of Azov both armies passed 
 on the defensive. </p>
<p>The German command was unable to achieve its goals, even if with the 
 his offensive had managed to re-occupy a part of the north-eastern areas and 
 Oriental of Ukraine. But these successes cost a very high price. 
 One of the main objectives achieved by Soviet troops in 
 Winter campaign 1942-1943 was the elimination of the siege of Leningrado. The 
 breakdown of the fortified defense of the enemy was made by the troops 
 of the Leningrado front, under the command of the Lieutenant-General L. A. Govorov and from 
 Those of the Volchov front, under the command of the Army General K. A. Merezkov. </p>
<p>For the offensive, the sector south of Lake Ladoga was chosen along the line 
 German Schlüsselburg-Sinjavino. The attacks of the troops of the two fronts 
 they were concerted in order to take the Germans between two fires and from 
 allow the combination of the soldiers of the red army for the most way 
 brief. </p>
<p>By understanding the strategic importance of this sector, the Hitlerians VI 
 concentrated large forces well trained in actions in forest areas- 
 marshy. 
 In the space of a long period the Germans had built a series of 
 Powerful fortifications defensed in Scaglioni. The assault on these positions was 
 extremely difficult. After completing long and accurate preparations, 
 The troops of the fronts of Leningrado and Volchov passed to the offensive on 12 
 January 1943. </p>
<p>At the breakdown of the siege, the sailors of the fleet of the 
 Baltic(comandati dal viceammiraglio V. Tribuz)and of the war flotilla
fighting Soviet troops were reason for the defense of the enemy e 
 On January 18 they joined the area of the suburbs workers n. 1 and n. 5. 
 The siege of Leningrado was broken. Along the southern coast of the lake 
 Ladoga was formed an 8-11 km wide corridor, along which the city was able to 
 restore the connection to the ground with the rest of the country. In this 
 Corridor was built in a short time a railway that in February 1943 
 He entered into operation. The Leningradesis called her "Victory Railway". </p>
<p>The breakdown of the siege made the Leningrad situation less precarious. For 18 
 months the lengledesi, enduring unspeakable privations, had been 
 subjected to a complete siege by the enemy. Overall, 
 Especially in the first winter of the siege, they had died of hunger and for the 
 Enemy attacks over 600 thousand inhabitants. </p>
<p>But the Leningradesi resisted. For the whole world the defense of Leningrado 
 He became the symbol of the will of the Soviet people to win the enemy. 
 The President of the United States of America Roosevelt, in the diploma sent to 
 Leningrado, wrote- "On behalf of the people of the United States of America I deliver 
 This diploma to the city of Leningrado in memory of its valiant 
 fighters and his faithful inhabitants, men, women and children, who isolated 
 by the remaining part of their people and despite the continuous bombings e 
 The unspeakable suffering caused by hunger, cold and diseases defended 
 successfully their dear city in the critical period from 8 September 1941 to 
 January 18, 1943, thus rising to a symbol of the invincible spirit of the 
 peoples of the Union of Soviet socialist republics and all 
 peoples of the world that oppose the forces of aggression ". The deeds 
 of the heroic defenders of the city of Lenin have remained impressed forever 
 in the memory of the peoples of the world. </p>
<p>In February and March 1943 in the central and northwestern sectors of the 
 in front of offensive operations were carried out for the liquidation of two 
 Outposts of the enemy, deeply under the troop device 
 Soviet. On February 15, 1943 the troops of the North-West front in command of the 
 Marshal Timošenko and the III armed assault on the Kalinin front 
 The offensive began against the units of the XVI German Army, attested 
 in the "Demjansk bag", without however being able to surround and destroy the 
 enemy troops. The Germans, suffering strong losses, escaped 
 to lighter. </p>
<p>In the fights north of Velikije-Luki, on February 23, on the day 
 anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army, he made a heroic enterprise the 
 Nineteen -year -old young communist Aleksandr matrossov. He obstructed with his 
 body a mitraglia's slit of an enemy fort and immolated its own 
 life guaranteed the success of his platoon. The name of Aleksandr matrossov, 
 Hero of the Soviet Union, is forever registered in the honor of the 254th 
 guard infantry regiment, which bears its name. </p>
<p>The troops of the West fronts and Kalinin developed an offensive in March 
 towards Ržev-Vjazma. Under the attacks of Soviet troops and fear 
 Threat of encirclement, the enemy was forced to retreat. The line 
 of the front was thus not only removed from another 130-160 km from Moscow to 
 West, but also Rercherciata. </p>
<p>The political-military importance of the winner of the Army 
 Red in the winter campaign 1942-1943 </p>
<p>For 4 and a half months, from mid -November 1942 to the end of March 1943, yes 
 the winter campaign continued, which register great victories 
 of the red army. A central place had in this campaign 
 the encirclement and annihilation of enemy troops on the Volga. </p>
<p>After supporting the pressure of fascist troops in the summer of 1942, 
 The Red Army inflicted on them a decisive blow. As had happened at 
 Moscow, in the difficult conditions of defensive fighting, was prepared 
 A counter -offensive of Soviet troops on a strategic scale. However the 
 situation in which the winter campaign 1942-1943 began and took place, yes 
 It substantially distinguished from the situation of winter 1941-1942. Under Moscow 
 The defeat of the German troops was obtained in a situation in which the 
 Economic and military resources of the country were far from being 
 completely used, while the rear were in a situation 
 extremely difficult. </p>
<p>The Red Army, having suffered enormous losses in men and means in the summer 
 1941, could not yet ensure a decisive superiority on the enemy and launched 
 the counter -offensive by having very limited forces and means. This was one 
 of the main causes for which the battle in front of Moscow was unable to 
 realize the encirclement and destruction of great enemy forces. </p>
<p>In autumn 1942 the situation was different. In the country there was already a
of summer 1942, to supply the army of the necessary quantity of means 
 and armaments. The solidity of the rear, the rapid and energetic mobilization 
 of the entire economy for the needs of the war, the work of the people, 
 directed by the Communist Party, they were the premise that he assured the army 
 Red the opportunity to move on to the counter -offensive. </p>
<p>The Soviet armed forces, tempered in previous battles, equipped with 
 experience and of great combative skills, they could now face and 
 Solve offensive tasks on a strategic scale. No occasional causes, but the 
 solidity of the socialist regime, awareness of duty by 
 all the people and their high patriotism, allowed the Soviet Union 
 not only to resist in the hard struggle, but also to turn the course of the course 
 all world war in favor of the anti -fascist coalition. </p>
<p>The victory of Soviet weapons on the Volga was the result of heroic efforts 
 of the entire Soviet people, of their realizations on the military front and 
 economic. This victory raised the moral of Soviet citizens, who 
 They saw that their blood and their work had not been in vain. It gave it 
 new forces to those who continued to languish under the yoke of 
 Fascist invaders. The defeat of the enemy armies on the Volga broke the 
 precious war car forged by the German generals for the attacks of 
 Hitler. </p>
<p>The myth of the invincibility of the German army fell miserably, while 
 The strategic initiative was taken away forever. The historical victory over the 
 Volga allowed the red army to develop a general offensive on 
 large scale and to start the liberation of the Soviet territory from 
 invaders. During the winter campaign German troops not only 
 they lost everything they had reached in the summer of 1942, but were forced 
 to abandon a series of cities and regions, where they had been in the 
 1941. </p>
<p>At some points the front moved west of 600-700 km. A big 
 territory of 480 thousand square kilometers was freed from the invaders. The 
 populations of the regions of Voronež and Stalingrado, of the republics 
 autonomous of Ceceno-English, northern obsessia, Cabardino-Bo-Balcaria e 
 of the Calmucchi, of the territory of Stavropol, of the autonomous regions of the 
 about, of the Caraciai and the Adigheti, of almost the whole territory of 
 Krasnodar, of the regions of Rostov and Kursk, of considerable part of the regions 
 by Vorošilovgrad, Smolensk and Orël regained freedom. </p>
<p>The connections interrupted by the enemy on many railways were restored e 
 along the Volga. During the winter campaign 1942-1943 the attackers 
 Fascists suffered colossal losses. From October 1942 to March 1913 beyond 
 1,300,000 between soldiers and officers were taken by the enemy as strength 
 fighter. Particularly serious losses suffered satellite armies 
 of Germany. The III and the IV Romanian armies, the II Hungarian army, the VIII 
 Italian army had practically ceased to exist. The red army destroyed 
 or he captured enormous quantities of weapons and means of the enemy. But it wasn't 
 Only of human losses and materials suffered by Hitler's Germany and by 
 its allies. The defeats dropped the morality of the army and the 
 population of the countries of the fascist axis. </p>
<p>Fascist rulers were forced to announce a 3 -day mourning for 
 The fallen in Stalingrado. For the first time from the beginning of the war, in 
 days of February 1943, the inhabitants of German cities and villages 
 instead, they felt the marches of victory, the funeral strengthening of the 
 bells of the churches. 
 He also changed the tone of German propaganda, who began to talk about the 
 Difficulty and the crisis of the German army in the East. Among the Germans yes 
 widespread the "disease" that the Germanic command called "influence 
 of the soul ", expressing in skepticism A in the growing distrust in the 
 Final victory. </p>
<p>Propaganda and terrorism could no longer heal this 
 "illness". The defeats in the East shook the entire fascist block. Between the 
 Germany and his allies was created an atmosphere of mutual distrust, yes 
 the dissensions that testified to the crisis that began in the lair intensified 
 of the powers of the axis. Germany's influence was also weakened 
 in neutral countries. Japan, which had to enjoy the fruits of the 
 military successes of the axis troops and that awaited only the moment 
 propitious to attack the Soviet Union, he was forced to give up his own 
 intentions. </p>
<p>The victory of the Red Army on the Volga and the subsequent Soviet offensive 
 they marked the beginning of the radical turning point not only during the great 
 Patriotic war of the Soviet people, but also of the whole second war 
 world. This fact was recognized all over the world. In the diploma 
 sent to the defenders of Stalingrado, President Roosevelt wrote that "there
Turn the war of allied nations against aggression ". </p>
<p>Under the influence of events on the Soviet-German front, it developed 
 With greater force the liberation struggle of the peoples of Europe and Asia 
 against Hitler's tyranny. </p>
<p>Thanks to the victory of the Soviet troops, the conditions were created 
 favorable for a greater commitment of all the forces of the anti- 
 Hitleriana. 
 In autumn 1942 the fascist block lined up on the Soviet-German front the 
 Most of their armed forces- 266 divisions of which 193 Germans. 
 This fact allowed the allies of the Soviet Union to start 
 A victorious offensive in North Africa. </p>

 judicial and criminalization of those who fight and repudiate to attacks 
 media, judicial and political to popular movements and in 
 solidarity with colleagues who have suffered and suffer threats and 
 Attacks </p>
<p>We converged with sectors that put the center in the political trial of the 
 Supreme Court, and in the attempt of proscription to Vice President Cristina 
 Fernández de Kirchner. </p>
<p>After the national anthem, representatives of the organizations spoke 
 present, including Taty Almeida de Mothers Founding Line, Hugo Yaski de 
 CTA of the workers, Ramiro "Vasco" Berdesegar of the CCC, Hugo Cachorro 
 Godoy de Cta Autónoma, Omar Plaini de Canillitas, Héctor Amichetti of the 
 Buenos Aires Graphic Federation, Deputy Juan Marino, Judge Juan María 
 Ramos Padilla, closing the act Nora Cortiñas de Mothers founding line who 
 He claimed for “a dignified homeland, without judicial mafia, without the scoundrels that 
 They ignored human rights when they signed the 2 × 1 ”. They were 
 present a large number of leaders and officials, including three 
 Ministers and ministers of the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires. </p>
<p><strong> Words of Ramiro "Vasco" Berdesegar of the CCC </strong> </p>
<p>Ramiro Berdesegar highlighted the unity of social organizations, 
 union, policies, human and religious rights present and sent “a 
 fraternal greeting, hot and class, to the original companions, 
 peasants, students, workers who marched to Lima, and that from the 
 December 7 face the coup d'etat and repression. We have no doubts 
 that in those companions the flag of Murillo, of Tupac Amaru, of 
 Micaela Bastidas, Panchito Solano and each of the companions who have 
 left life by the emancipation of this Latin America. A huge applause 
 For each of them and we shout, live the rebellion of the people of Peru!” </p>
<p>“Yesterday the data of the last census were known- 46,044,703 
 inhabitants that populate our Argentina from north to south. That points a 
 Growth of 14.77% of our population since the last census in 2010. 
 Graph the dynamism, the life of our people, growth. The other face 
 of the static of those who want to stay forever are the four 
 "Supreme" that for years have only install a parallel government 
 to defend the interests of the economic groups that hide behind 
 They, ”said Berdesegar. </p>
<p>The CCC leader gave more census data and referring to the percentage of 
 Women pointed out that “there are the thousands of companions who every day 
 They stir the pot in popular dining rooms, the thousands that guarantee the 
 production, the thousands of peasants, many of them without land, which 
 guarantee food in each of the green belts, the women who 
 They took the step forward as health promoters in the pandemic, which did not 
 These are the women represented in this nefarious Supreme Court, these 
 four that not only from their class perspective also from their 
 Gender perspective only print failures against our people. ” </p>
<p>Berdesegar pointed out that due to the data of the census the province of Buenos Aires is 
 The one that has more inhabitants, more than 17 million, follows Córdoba, Santa Fe and 
 Fourth CABA, with 3,120,000, wondering “what galaxy do these live 
 "Supreme" when they impose a ruling that threatens federalism and 
 co -participation, like what they did a few months ago? " </p>
<p>“It is clear that when one reads each of the failures of this addicted justice 
 to macrismo only find the defense of class interests of 
 the true owners of this country, of the 1,823 great landowners who 
 They have 50% of the productive land in our homeland at the expense of thousands of 
 peasants, from natives, displaced from land and territory. 
 In these failures the interests that price formers have 
 And food producers, those 20 large companies, which every day 
 They take away food, meat, milk from our kids. </p>
<p>"But also in each of the failures of that justice a deep is hidden 
 class hate to popular sectors. Class hate that they left expressed 
 when they ratified the condemnation of the companion Milagro Sala. Class hate that 
 The judge has expired that from November 2021 to July last year, to 
 Although there was no evidence against false complaints, he ordered us to 
 click the phones to dozens of leaders and companions of 
 Our organization ordered physical persecution from our homes and

<p><img alt="" src="Images/ap23029343183231.jpg" />The meeting of organizations and organizations took place on Tuesday 31/1 in Athens 
 Collectives, on the basis of the KKE proposal(μ-λ)for 'wide anti -war 
 Common Action in February. " This proposal is deposited in view of 
 Completion of one year from the start of the war in Ukraine, as well as the 
 Planned visit to the US Foreign Minister, Blinken, to Greece 
 and in countries in the region. </p>
<p>The meeting was attended by representatives of NAP, the CMA, ARA, LAD, her 
 Clash and the popular front. In his placement the KKE(μ-λ)testified 
 his view of developments and presented the content of the proposal 
 of, dictated by the need to break the long silence and inactivity 
 of the movement with regard to the US-NATO imperialist conflict with 
 Russia in Ukraine and the nightmares it feeds. As out of 
 of this, proposed mobilizing on 21 February, day that 
 is close to the one -year anniversary of the beginning of the war and 
 It is also rumored that Blinken will visit the country. The proposed 
 Mobilization concerns us so much the complaint of the unjust war that 
 raging, of the imperialists starring in the slaughter, of the local ruler 
 class that turns the country into a base for its American bosses 
 and involves the people on this basis in its reactionary confrontation with 
 Turkish bourgeoisie as well as the racing condemnation of his arrival 
 Representative of American imperialism. From this content derives 
 and the path of demonstration we believe should be followed, 
 Opposite to both embassies, American and Russian. </p>
<p>On the side of NAP, the CMA and the match, with the special views 
 Of course of each organization, there was a general agreement on its content 
 Proposal. However, disagreements were expressed - from different starting points - in relation to 
 with the proposed route of the demonstration. NAP and CMA, participating 
 together in anti -war initiative, they proposed the realization 
 separate concentration at two embassies on a different date than 
 Blinken visit. </p>
<p>In the placements of the rest of the forces, indifference to the 
 Need to terminate war and an attempt to separate it from 
 Blinken Visit, with exclusive focus on the answer to 
 Give the movement to it. Fact which did not cause us special 
 impression, as the views of a series of organizations on the 
 Issue, moving from the - deprived - acquittal of Russian imperialism 
 up to the overt acceptance of the subjugation of peoples' interests to 
 His choices, in the name of anti -Americanism and anti -fascism. To 
 The following confrontation emerged were the obstacles set by such 
 placements in the organization of anti -war mobilization, with the reluctance of 
 This is openly confessed by both Ara and Lad. From 
 the side of the ARA the only reference proposed in relation to the war was the 
 One -sided complaint of the expansion of NATO, western sanctions and the 
 Model for "peaceful settlement" of the conflict. </p>
<p>Given the inability to end in an agreement, the appointment was renewed 
 by setting a new meeting for Friday 3/2. In spite of the intense 
 Disagreements between political forces, on our part, insist on 
 attempt to find commonplace for the realization of anti-imperialist- 
 anti -war mobilization, utilizing the moods expressed for the 
 Conducting a course against the challenge of visiting the representative of 
 America in the country. As part of this effort, we declare the 
 our mood to seek compromises and modify items of 
 of our proposal, but without having the intent at the content level of 
 We do behind the essence of the slogan “Peoples do not need from 
 patrons' and leave one of his arsonists untouched 
 War and the murderers of the peoples.</p>
