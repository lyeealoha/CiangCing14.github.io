‘ _Some questions that should be posed to the fascists attempting to take
advantage of concerns in working class communities_.’

What solutions have you ever offered the working class in relation to the
artificially created housing crisis, soaring energy prices, the capitalist
rise in cost of living, the lack of jobs, training and education
opportunities, the deliberate destruction of our health and public services,
the decades of deliberate neglect and marginalisation by the state, the
partition and occupation of our country by foreign imperialist powers (the
real foreign threat), the changing of the balance of power from the golden
circle to the people?

You call yourselves patriots. What role have you played in the ongoing
struggle for National Liberation in our country? You know, the one where real
patriots have sacrificed their lives and their liberty for the freedom of
Ireland and the working class?

We know what your leaders have done. Justin Barrett and James Reynolds were in
Fine Gael, the Blueshirts, the anti-Republican party that has been in the
pocket of British Imperialism since 1922. Some patriots. And Hermann Kelly was
being educated in a university well known for links with MI5, before becoming
the lap-dog of Nigel Farage and the most aggressive form of British
imperialism and chauvinism. Maybe we misunderstood. When you call yourselves
‘patriots’ is it British patriots you mean? Again, no friends of the working
class.

As British patriots, is that why Free State fascist organisations are
consistently developing closer and closer links with loyalist death squads and
the British far right? The same death squads that kill innocent Irish citizens
on behalf of British imperialism and the same British far-right that ran
campaigns of hate against Irish immigrants under the banner ‘No blacks, no
dogs, no Irish!’ Are you being directed by MI5 to develop these links and act
in alliance against Irish National Liberation? Justin and Hermann certainly
have form.

Understanding that Irish people, due to 850 years of ongoing oppression, have
a long history of emigration, where our people have suffered racism, violence
and exploitation; Why protest against centres housing vulnerable asylum
seekers fleeing war-torn and destitute countries, seeking international
protection, instead of against those who are really creating the problems,
namely the Free State administration, British, European and US Imperialism,
NATO, the capitalist class and in particular landlords? Is it because you are
in fact in alliance with these same powers and view yourselves very much as
part of their club?

No answers? We thought so.

Fascists have nothing to offer the working class. They are pro-establishment,
pro-imperialist, pro-landlord and have no base in our communities. We won’t
let them get one now.

The Irish people have always been proudly anti-imperialist and anti-fascist.
Let us be proud of that tradition and not allow our fighting spirit to be
hijacked by far-right lies online or the fascist boot boys serving the agenda
of those in power.

Full consultation with the community when asylum seekers and refugees are to
be housed in an area is a must! No more lies. Information takes away fear and
consultation, information and communication will lead to genuine integration.
Resourcing is needed in all communities where asylum seekers and refugees are
to be housed. Housing for all, training and education opportunities, funding
for schools, sports clubs, healthcare and other community services are a must
and are a legitimate set of demands from working class communities.

Working class communities have genuine concerns. Anger at the cost of living,
the housing crisis, the collapse of our healthcare system and being ignored by
those in power for generations have led to anger coming to boiling point. But
that anger must be channeled in the right way. Our communities won’t be fixed
by targeting vulnerable asylum seekers, refugees or migrants and that only
serves the agenda of those in power as a distraction from the real issues.

The working class need a united front to fight against our exploitation by
those in power. The anger and protests need to be directed at those in
Leinster House, and Stormont, against the multinationals and international
imperialism. Against the landlords, the energy companies, the fascists and the
far right agitators. Building such a movement is the task for all of us who
believe in an Ireland owned and controlled by the people, in the Republic
proclaimed in 1916.

And remember, if anyone is calling for protests against asylum seekers or
scapegoating refugees or migrants, they are serving the interests of those in
power and should be isolated and unwelcome in our communities. Let’s focus on
our real enemies and not allow ourselves to be divided and conquered by those
in power!

For a United Working Class - Ireland for the People - All of the People!
