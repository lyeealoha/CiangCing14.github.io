<p>In his call, the federalism wrote: "The climate crisis is the result of social misprints, it has the person responsible and they also sit in Basel. For example, the Syngenta group, which sells agricultural poisons and genetically different seeds all over the world. [... ] Middle Greenwashing then try to use many corporations, such as Tesla, the awareness of the climate crisis in order to promote their goods, as it were, to promote their profits and to deny their own responsibility. The world becomes destroyed and Profitors are also sitting here in Switzerland and are trimmed by the Swiss state. We do not accept this for a long time, but support Wirden's resistance to the international climate movement to the center of this exploitation system. "</p>
<p>The demonstration started at 3:00 p.m. at the DE-Wette-Park and pulled the downtown Basel from there. From the beginning, the unannounced demonstration dye was cut by the police, blocked streets and so on. When Diedemonstration finally tried to penetrate Barfusserplatz, a central square in downtown Basel, the police were shot by the police and irritant gas. Here the overall demonstration was covered with floors and the bulls gave the shot soab that many of the rubber red floors hit the demonstration at head height. Despite the massive efforts to blow up the Diedemonstration, the deomnstration participants managed to penetrate Zruckzen and to adapt the route so that the demo could still be enforced successfully.<img alt="Baelklimarev copy" src="Images/DEM VOLKE DIENEN/2023-02-11T20-17-58-00-00/bAELKLIMAREV_-_Kopie.jpg" />In addition to different advanced power within the vernicism and ofdaruber, a common contingent of proletarian revolutionary from the FRG and partizan also participated in the demonstration with a transparent with the inscription "No to deals and compromises - for dierevolution!" And red flags with hammer and sickle. At this point we also want to emphasize our joy over banners, which was given by forces from the bundle and calls up the solidarity with the agricultural revolution in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Socialist Revolution has received documentation of several actions conducted in Copenhagen over the weekend.</p>
<p>Anti -imperialist collective organized a protest in front of the Brazilian ambassade, where leaflets condemning the Rondônia massacre committed the military police and armed gangs by local landlords were handed out in angels. At the same time, the flyers also condemned the terror, committed against the Mexican people in the state of Oaxaca, against the poor farmers who resist deeMperialist mega projects being developed in the area.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/1-3.jpg" />The activists held a banner that says "down with the criminalization camp by country!" In both Danish and Portuguese.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/2-4.jpg" /><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/3-3.jpg" />Requirement that the terror against the people of Brazil and Mexico should be stopped was hung the entrance to the embassy, while battle cry to support LCP.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/4-2.jpg" />Anti -imperialist collective also organized a protest in front of the Mexican ambassed, where the same leaflets were handed out. The activists held Etbanner with the slogan "Freedom of all political prisoners!", While demanding Atalle the people's fighters from Mexico and Brazil were to be presented ilive, while at the same time condemning the murders of the murdered people's fighters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/5-2.jpg" />The activists report that during the protest, a company consisting of ingredient businessmen resigned, one of which was the owner of a major Brazilian agricultural company. The owner of the agricultural company recognized the parole to LCP and was shocked that LCP also enjoys support from Etimperialist Land as Denmark.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/6-2.jpg" />In the proletarian neighborhood Blågården, a banner was hung up that the condemn massacre committed against the poor farmers in Brazil up.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/7-2.jpg" /><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/8-2.jpg" />We have received the leaflets, which were distributed in front of both embassies and re -represent them below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/9-2.jpg" /><img alt="" src="Images/SOCIALISTISK REVOLUTION/2023-02-12T12-48-26-00-00/10-2.jpg" />_Proletarians of all countries, unite!_In the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, the poor peasants have beenfighting for years against mega-projects that the old state is building incooperation with the imperialists. The peasants are being robbed of their landso that huge wind farms can be built on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In thisway, the peasants are expropriated, nature is destroyed and the population isdisplaced.</p>
<p>The resistance that the peasants have been putting up for years is being metwith repression and terror by the old Mexican state and its henchmen. In orderto break the struggle of the peasants and the different popular movements thathave taken up the task of developing resistance against the imperialist mega-projects, the state is setting paramilitary murder gangs on the population.This situation has worsened drastically in the last few weeks. Severalpeople's militants have been arrested or disappeared without trace. On the29th of January 2023, armed paramilitaries acting on behalf of the biglandowners occupied the community of Rincon Tagolaba threatening theresidents, destroying cultivated land and drinking water pipes and firingshots to intimidate them. The national police arrived but did nothing againstthe heavily armed paramilitaries.</p>
<p>The Mexican state, with the help of the murderous gangs that work for it, isenforcing the interests of the imperialists at the expense of the people ofthe Isthmus of Tehuantepec and any means will do. Our solidarity is with thestruggling poor peasants and the popular movements, such as the People’sCurrent Red Sun(Red Sun People's Current), which fights tirelessly andsacrificially for the needs and interests of the people. <strong>We demand therelease of all imprisoned fighters of the people. We demand the immediate livepresentation of the disappeared. We demand an end to the repression and terrorof the old Mexican state and its henchmen.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In addition, news reached us of another massacre of poor peasants in theBrazilian state of Rondônia, once again perpetrated by the local biglandowners. The two farmers Rodrigo and Raniel were tortured and murdered in abestial way. Both were found extremely violated. Pictures of Raniel's bodyshow that a large piece of his skull has been knocked out. The pictures of thetwo are frightening and show the brutality with which the Brazilian state andthe big landowning class are acting against revolutionary forces.<strong>Therefore, then as now, we call on all friends of the Brazilian people andthe LCP to participate in the rally and denounce and condemn these renewedmurders!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We declare eternal honor and glory to the fallen comrades in the strugglefor land  We demand punishment for the executors and commissioners of the murders of thepeople's fighters!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop the terror against the Brazilian People!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop the terror against the Mexican People!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop the criminalisation of the struggle for land!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long live the LCP and Corriente del Pueblo Sol Rojo!</strong></p>

Time and again there are massacresby the Brazilian state, the big landowners and their henchmen. In April 2021,the Brazilian state carried out a massacre in Santa Elina, in the ManoelRibero camp, where several peasants were murdered. For days and weeks, thecamp was terrorised, isolated from the outside world and sealed off. Theentire camp, where the collective life and work of the poor peasants wasorganised on land they occupied, was razed to the ground. Nevertheless, thestruggle of the LCP and the poor and landless peasants organised in itcontinued.</li>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> There is a critical shortage of personnel, especially nurses and doctors, in the Norwegian health care system. Government officials warn that the future means even more patients per employee. </strong></p>
<p>As of February 2022, about half of Norwegian municipalities reported "challenging or critical access to personnel and critical competence". In particular, doctors and nurses municipalities notified a lack of. This was expressed in the lack of capacity for GPs, emergency rooms, home services, institutions, vaccination, testing and infection tracking. This situation was an exception that was only due to the pandemic handling that was then in full swing. The nurses' trade union now states that this is the current situation: «Nursing shortages and other personnel shortages are everywhere, in the municipalities and nursing hospitals. It's a crisis. "</p>
<p>The Health Personnel Commission was reduced by the government to assess the situation with a lack of personnel in the health care system. According to the Trade Union, which organizes hundreds of thousands of public employees, the Commission recommends _Ine_at overall health and care personnel should not increase significantly beyond the current level. Instead, they suggest that more employees work full time. The Commission also states that "more efforts need to be done and that <strong> people take care of their own health </strong> to reduce the pressure on health services"(our highlight).</p>
<p>Kommisjonslederen har slått fast overfor NRK at det blir færre ansatte perpasient. Den demografiske utviklingen ligger til grunn: Det blir flere eldre,samtidig som det fødes færre barn. Utvalgsleder Gunnar Bovim sier: «Dethjelper ikke med en milliard her og en milliard der. Det blir færre ansatteper pasient. Den erkjennelsen må vi ta med oss på alle nivå.»</p>
<p>Dermed står norsk helsevesen i den situasjonen at man på den ene siden har en_personellmangelkrise_ : Det er for få ansatte, for få arbeidstimer, oghalvparten av kommunene klarer ikke å gi den helsetjenesten folk har krav på.På den andre sida vil det bli <em>færre</em> , ikke flere, ansatte i forhold tilpasienter i årene som kommer!For å gjøre situasjonen enda verre varslerhelseministeren innstramminger på grunn av dyrtida.</p>

<p><strong> Our comrades in Sol Rojista write about the popular resistance and organization against the State War against the People and the Imperialistemega project Corredor Interoceánico del Istmo de Tehuantepec(Ciit).</strong></p>
<p>Krigen mot folket intensiveres og operasjonene til den gamle godseier-byråkratiske staten konsentreres mot arbeiderne og folket som gjør motstand.Regimet fokuserer på å omringe, isolere, kriminalisere og ødelegge denfolkelige bevegelsen, spesielt den antikapitalistiske venstresida.    De siste hendelsene i landet gir et klarere bilde av situasjonen. I Michoacáner kameratene Ricardo Lagunes Gasca og Antonio Díaz Valencia forsvunnet,førstnevnte en demokratisk advokat og sistnevnte en lokal samfunnsleder somhar stått synlig i spissen for motstanden mot gruveprosjektet «Las Encinas».    I Istmo de Tehuantepec har det vært flere angrep i løpet av en periode på touker. Det første skjedde 17. januar, da David Hernández Salazar, fra Binniza-samfunnet Puente Madera i San Blas Atempa, blei arrestert for protester motCIIT. En annen hendelse var trakasseringa av jordbrukere og andre medlemmer avlokalsamfunn nord i Isthmus. Disse hadde blokkert jernbanen etter å ha jagetCIIT-bygningsarbeidere som en gjengjeldelse mot at marinen 26. januar bleisatt inn for å prøve å skremme befolkninga. Deployeringen av marinen førtebare til nye protester og at flere bønder kom til og forsterka kampen.    Deretter, den 29. januar, kom 10 lastebiler med væpna menn inn ilokalsamfunnet Rincón Tagolaba i Tehuantepec. De reiv ned samfunnetsadgangsmerker og stolpene og gjerdene til husene, skøyt i lufta og satt fyr påeiendelene til befolkninga. Leiesoldaten «Tacho» Canasta og broren hans,Sergio Gutiérrez, som urettmessig kaller seg «kommissær» for Santa CruzTagolaba, sto i spissen for angrepet. Målet var å skremme folket og å overtasamfunnets jord, for å kunne forhandle med CIIT. Mange timer senere ankom enbetjent fra nasjonalgarden, etter at klager blei sendt inn tilmenneskerettighetsorganisasjoner, men da hadde angriperne alt trukket segtilbake, og tatt med seg bevisene for det væpna angrepet.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="Images/Tjen-Folket/2023-02-12T21-23-53-00-00/GZKmpGiPxHiMpRWHl6EIhvJmp_gi78IhBmMMerOuBPVx3E2umVsT9bClP-_h18uE0lSqSYI1PSmUbWGplhM91J5irOmGQt-hIzVD_8gvqoFlz9Ewt9PSeqaiUoF84oJLWhRRqUD6j6FWP3u7" /></p>
<p>In the statement, the Gutiérrez García brothers are held directly responsible for any armed armed or aggression against the Rincón Tagolaba community, as well as for the densphysical and emotional integrity of the peasant families living there. It requires the authorities to safeguard the integrity of society and the inhabitants, and the setter definitely stops to this wave of attacks, and recalls that the Gutiérrezgarcía brothers are linked to at least four criminal cases, and emphasize that these attacks from mercenaries and paramilitarian groups, with State, with State, with State, with the State, with the State, with the State, with the State, with the State, with the State, with the State, with the State, Is the people's reaction organization and militant mobilization.</p>
