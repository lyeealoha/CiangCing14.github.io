**West Singhbhum District, February 8, 2023:** Yet another IED blast triggeredby cadres of the CPI (Maoist) caused a CRPF jawan to sustain an injury onTuesday. The incident occurred in the forests of Jharkhand's West Singhbhumdistrict.

The injured jawan was identified as Sanjiv Kumar who belongs to the CRPFâ€™s 60battalion fell victim to the blast. The forces were carrying out an anti-Maoist operation at Hathiburu jungle in the Porahat forest division that fallsunder the Goelkera police station area about 160 km away.

Soon after the incident, the police and the paramilitary forces rescued thevictim and took him to a hospital in Ranchi by helicopter.

As the news reached, the West Singhbhum superintendent of police, AshutoshShekhar rushed to Goelkera. Goelkera police station OC, Rahul Kumar Singh whohad joined the rescue operation said the injured CRPF jawan is out of danger.

It is the fifth explosion triggered by cadres of the CPI (Maoist) in thePorahat and adjoining Kolhan forest divisions, which have emerged as the newstronghold of the Maoists.

As of now 15 jawans have sustained injuries caused by the IED explosions inthat troubled region since January 11, the day when the police started thejoint operation against the Maoists there.

Earlier the Maoists would focus on carrying out their activities in Sarandaforest, but due to the presence of an adequate number of CRPF personnel there,the Maoists had chosen the adjoining Kolhan forest division to make theirpresence felt.

A squad of 16 armed Maoist cadres is still active at the Porahat forestdivision.
