The operation was aimed at several homes, a refugee camp and a hospital. It was justified by the Israeli authorities as an action against so -called 'terrorists', as the national liberation movement and other opponents call. Members of the national liberation organizations Hamas and Islamicaticjihad defended themselves against the massacre, some of them with firearms.</p>
<p>Among the dead, in addition to several young men, was also a 61-year-old woman, in order to speak, was executed in her own home with a shot in the neck. In addition, a tear gas grenade was fired at a children's ward at a local hospital, whereby more children were injured. On January 26, the Israeli army murdered 10palestinians and wounded 20 others, some seriously, during a military operation in the town of Jenin in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Since last year, there has again been a huge increase in Israeli terror against the Palestinian people. 225 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli occupation forces last year - the highest number in 15 years. In January 2023, 30 Palestinians have already been killed.</p>
<p>But with this attack, the opposition of the Palestinian people also grows. After the military operation in Jenin, Hamas fired two rockets against Israel Fragaza Strip. Therefore, crowds went on the streets to protest the resurrection and the ongoing reactionary operations. In Jerusalem, Disposable Security Forces against a demonstration and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian. On Friday, January 27, Israel bombed the densely populated gaza strip. According to the official statements, only the military position attacks, which Israel officially announced after each bombardment, which is of course a lie.</p>

<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> In March, there is a temporary stop of the possibility of patients medium disorders to apply for active euthanasia in Canada. The state introduced the agent prohibition after the offer was first expanded, in order to be able to develop guidelines for patients with mental disorders. </strong></p>
<p>Head of the euthanasia team at Huber River Hospital in Toronto, Dr. Sonu Gainder concerned about the expansion of Canada's "Medical Assistance in Dying"(MAID)program. The doctor is also a psychiatrist and assists the hospital in preparing rules for active euthanasia, as well as following up the applications.</p>
<p>In an episode of the podcast "Full Comment", Dr. Gind explains that Aktivdødejelp(MAID)became legal in Canada in 2016, but with the requirement that the sickness is "serious, indispensable, and that natural death as a result is reasonable". According to the doctor, the offer was intended to "help those who already dying to die". Due to the reservation that the patient already had to die, mental disorders did not fall into the offer, as mental disorders themselves are not deadly, or can be said to be incurable. Allered in 2019, 2% of those who died in Canada Maida Maid. In 2020, this increased to 2.5%.</p>
<p>In March 2021, the law was amended, and the patient group that could get Maid was expanded. The law was liberalized and the requirement for predictable death was removed. Dr This opened up vague and unscientific assessments whether who can get or not.</p>
<p>For example, "The Spectator" writes about a woman who stated it "right also cannot afford to live anymore" as a reason, or a woman who did not hide to move to a house that did not aggravate her allergies. Among some of those who have been granted Maid, there are also patients with feelings of Å not living up to expectations, of being a burden on others, as well as patients who have experienced several difficulties and tragedies in life. According to "Thespectator", a seriously ill man also testified in court that hospital employees tested to push him to apply for the offer.Dr. Gind points in particular to two reasons why this is a problem:</p>
<p>First, the research does not support the hypothesis that there are people who hated their lives on their own regardless of who want active euthanasia. Most of the suicide attempts are not enforced, and most people do not try to take their lives. Thus, there is no basis for saying that people who are currently eruicidal would die anyway. The doctor concludes that the offer "changes one -volatile suicidality to death."</p>
<p>Thus, the first group of people who want to die with dignity and control over their own lives are preserved. While the other group is people who are not necessarily looking to die with the dignity in mind, but rather are the outfits of fleeing life's suffering, such as social evils such as poverty, loneliness and isolation.</p>
<p>Gain also points out that although people with mental disorders are capable of making certain decisions, their thought processes are affected by the disability. "Those who are depressed think differently; They think 'I'm bad, the world is bad, the future will be bad'. " It is thus difficult to conclude that a severe depressed person may be considered to be able to make decisions of this type. This becomes especially clear when the research is that most mentally ill will improve again.</p>
<p>Maid was expanded under slogans about increased autonomy. Dr. Gind shows simple -collectivist thinking and class awareness when he argues against this: A rich person's right to end life on his own terms has a negative impact on those who are already exposed. He calls it pre -privilege policy: "It is age discrimination, any discrimination. It opens up for the most marginalized dies too early ”.</p>
<p>During discussions about the expansion of Maid in Canada, the budget committee showed the Idparliament to figures that showed how much money the state will save on medical expenses, while the Canadian Psychological Association accused opponents of the expansion for "discrimination against the mentally ill". It is not presented with figures that indicate that most mentally ill will be better.<strong>Referanser:</strong> <strong>  </strong><a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/were-killing-off-the-sad-and-the-poor-with-maid-full-comment-with-anthony-furey">Killing off the sad and the poor with maid – Full Comment With AnthonyFurey  </a><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-is-canada-euthanising-the-poor/">The Spectator – Why is Canada Euthanizing the poor? </a><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/medical-assistance-dying.html#a2">Medical Assistance in Dying – Government of Canada  </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/maid-deadline-extension-mental-illness-1.6687429">CBC – Government seeking delay to MAID expansion that wouldcover mental illness</a></p>

Let us also look forward to the 130th birth anniversary ofChairman Mao Zedong later this year and Ka Joma's 85th birth anniversary nextyear by studying with all energy the classic writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin,Stalin, Mao, Ho as well as those of Ka Joma, and using them as guide as wecarry forward with all vigor the national democratic revolution.</p>
<p>As founding chair and guide of the CPP, Ka Joma incisively analyzed thesemicolonial and semifeudal conditions in the country and pointed to thenecessity of carrying out a people's democratic revolution by wagingprotracted people's war along the strategy of encircling the cities from thecountryside.</p>
<p>Wielding both the New People's Army and the National Democratic Front as swordand shield respectively, the Party has achieved myriad revolutionary successesover more than five decades. The victories accumulated in waging resistanceand building revolutionary power are testament to the correctness and lastingvalidity of Ka Joma's teachings and to the indefatigable determination of theParty's cadres to carry forward the tasks of the Philippine revolution.</p>
<p>Inspired by Ka Joma's boundless revolutionary optimism, the Party and allpatriotic and democratic forces are determined to bring the nationaldemocratic revolution to final victory, no matter the sacrifice and howeverlong it takes. The liberation of the Filipino people from imperialism,feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism hinges on winning the revolution.This study movement is characterized by a review of the basic principles ofthe Party as laid out by Ka Joma in the first and second great rectificationmovements. Party cadres are also carrying out further research and socialinvestigation to enrich and deepen understanding of the semicolonial andsemifeudal conditions of the people.</p>
<p>Through this study movement, leading committees of the Party have takeninitiative in self-criticism efforts to identify, root out, repudiate andrectify errors of subjectivism which have impeded the growth of therevolutionary movement and weakened it in some parts. The level ofrevolutionary energy and enthusiasm is steadily rising, and with it, theFilipino people's determination to carry forward the revolution.</p>
<p>In the field of armed struggle, Party cadres in the New People's Army areexerting efforts to surmount the problem of self-constriction in order toconsistently expand and deepen the mass base and take the initiative inmounting annihilative tactical offensives combined with widespread attritivetactical offensives. In the field of the mass movement in both the cities andcountryside, revolutionary forces are overcoming problems of reformism,legalism and conservatism in order to expand the people's organized strength,lead their democratic struggles, raise their struggles against imperialistneoliberal policies and military intervention, and link and extend support tothe armed struggle.</p>
<p>A vigorous study movement of Ka Joma's teachings is bound to take root amongthe Filipino youth and students, ensuring the emergence of a new generation ofrevolutionaries and communists who will lead the Party and carry forward therevolution into the future. The campaign to promote Marxism-Leninism-Maoismand a culture of revolutionary collectivism and selfless service to thepeople, especially among young intellectuals, direct challenges the culture ofsocial apathy, individualism, self-centeredness, hedonism and other rottenanti-social traits being promoted by imperialism and the ruling classes inmedia and social media.The viciousness with which the Armed Forces of the Philippines(AFP)wages itscounter-revolution, however, succeeds only in further exposing the rottennessof the ruling system. Fascist violence is inciting the broad masses of thepeople to fight back. It shows them that there is no path to attain theiraspiration for justice and freedom other than the revolutionary mass movementand armed struggle.</p>
<p>Amid aggravation of the crisis of overproduction of the global capitalistsystem, the leading imperialists powers are resorting to wars and pushing theentire world towards the brink of widespread death and destruction. Theconditions of great disorder and turbulence being generated by the globalcapitalist system is compelling the proletariat to rise up and lead theoppressed and exploited classes to wage revolution.</p>
<p>Guided by Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and the teachings of Ka Joma, the CommunistParty of the Philippines vows to persevere in leading the Filipino peoplealong the path of the national democratic revolution. Together with risinganti-imperialist and antifascist struggles around the world, the Party isdetermined to contribute to the resurgence of socialist and new democraticrevolutions worldwide and help forge a new period in the world history of theproletariat.</p>

<p><strong> Meanwhile, we publish excerpts of the intervention on the war in Ukraine Intellectual Marxist Fatodalla Carla Filosa in the previous anti -capitalist Professional Assembly last September. </strong></p>
<p>"The female role also within the war, because the woman who fabbli is simply that of an incubator who must produce non -sololavorers in peacetime but soldiers in war time; because the company never takes on the labors of the Expenses of the needs of the apopulations, but uses the populations, as we see in this war, in which the Ukrainian population is certainly paying the greater price in end of human lives and suffering of all kinds.</p>
<p>This war had been adequately prepared, we have known for years that there is a civil war in Ukraine, but it was like a piece of geography that did not give it, but it concerned us immediately when the Ukraine became our problem, close to 'Europe. In the Infghanistan wars, in Syria, Libya where they intervened to kill Gaddafi, they prevented Italy from having a role that today could be precisely because of the disbursement of gas and oil. Italy had had of this limitation.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine is the result of the immediate invasion aside by Russian imperialism, but in reality of an imperialistic preparation that led by the lowering of the importance of the dollar a</p>
<p>World level and from the need for utalous imperialism to strengthen it, because otherwise it loses its world hegemony, not only military hegemony also politics and drainage of wealth from the countries dominated towards Gristati United.</p>
<p>All the sanctions made to Russia are not only sanctions to Russia but I am bassing of the euro, given that these are not coins point, they marapeious the relationship between imperialisms expressed the terms of coins, concern the power of domination that can be obtained worldwide And that the period of the Cold War produced.We have the so -called "peace" in the sense that the bombs do not come, however, the consequences of this "peace" which are the consequences of a war of war, of restrictions, made of fear of inflation, of the installment of the economic recession that will be paid From the whole population. So, the Ukrainians can die, undergo heavy conditions of life - Egià Ukraine was not a very rich country, because the Ukrainians who we have come to us to look for work, so it meant that the profitable profit was very low - and It has no importance, the importance is the internationally competition markets.</p>
<p>This means the imperialist war. It is not simply a name that pertains to someone's badness, it is the mechanism of a system that is cracked; Because the crisis of the capital, the system crisis is preceding the war and the war is not simply the militarized expression of the plantity, as has been said by a hundred and more than years by Clausewitz, bad politics is the continuation of the war not in military terms Then war substantially means that there must be redefined rapportiegemonic within the world.</p>
<p>The importance of people's lives is zero, if they cannot be used they go to the pulp, because the lives of people does not exist in this one who simply lives on the exploitation of people ".</p>

<p>In the first chapter and in the first paragraph of it: "<em>The positioning position in front of the wars", Lenin writes: _ "The socialists have always condemned the wars between peoples as a thingBarbara and bestial. But our attitude in front of the war is fonduled differently different from that of the bourgeois pacifists(Peace and exploitors of peace)and anarchists. From the former we distinguish ourselves in how much we are the inevitable link of the wars with the struggle of the classinel of within each country, we understand the impossibility of destroying Leguerre without destroying classes and educating socialism, as well as we fully recognize the legitimacy the character Progressive and lanecessity of civil wars, that is, of the wars of the oppressed class counterquence that oppresses, slaves against the masters of slaves, of the servants of the match against the landowners, of the waged workers against laborghesia. And from the pacifists and from the anarchists we Marxists distinguish ourselves with the need for the need for the historical examination(From the point of view of Marx's dialectical materialism)of each individual war ... therefore the historical particates of proper to(Everything is fine)war..."</em></p>
<p>In the paragraph "<em>diffenza between wars of aggression and defense wars</em>", Lenin underlines the difference between two eras, the one that precedes the affirmation of capitalism and those that take place in the period of imperialism.</p>
<p>In the first period it is said: _ "When it comes to the legitimacy of the warfare, about the wars in this era, the socialists had always had the purposes, that is, the revolution against the Middle Ages and against the leaser of the Gleba. For" defensive war "the socialists In this sense, only in this sense, the socialists Hannoriconto and recognize the legitimacy, the progressive character and justodella defense of the homeland or of the defensive war have always intended. <em>In the imperialist phase, in the imperialist Inter wars, in the countriesimperialists engaged in wars of aggression towards oppressed peoples, talking about "defensive or defense of the homeland would constitute historical unknown and only a deception of the simple people by the deeds ... the imperialist bourgeoisie of our time it deceives the popolisters of national ideology and the concept of defense of the homeland ".</em></p>
<p><strong> Lenin's statement is more appropriate in the examination of the war incurred in Ukraine. </strong></p>
<p>It inevitably produces the effects, on the Ukrainian masses, including Lemase del Donbass, and on the Russian soldiers and Ukrainians sent to the slaughterhouse, exactly described by Lenin in the definition of "barbarians and bestials". Glioorrori who come to us every day, despite being very thickly amplified and used as a war propaganda by the Stampadei Imperialista countries born NATO/Europe, including Italy, and, on the other hand, by the rigged information of Russian imperialism to lead Putin, They move the logic of "barbaric and bestial" things and of crimes against the humanity. While the imperialists consider crimes only those of the other of the parts and praise the freedom, democracy or self -determination of the deipopoli, which would take away from the barbarism of the war, in particular against civil lepopolations or against soldiers sent to the slaughterhouse, their character.</p>
<p>From this war propaganda are only the communists consistently, representatives of the proletarians and the oppressed classes of both authentic and evident and indeed "commissioner -commissioner and reactionary regimes as responsible for their states and governments from overturn as a necessary condition allowing this daily horror.</p>
<p>This is what distinguishes the communists from bourgeois pacifists, from the nationalists. Communists operate to intensify the class struggle inside, in this case, both of Ukraine and within the imperialist countries of which the Ukrainian regime is pawn and within Donbass and Russia Cheinvade.</p>
<p>This is the necessary condition because the end of this war is left, as is evidently the necessary condition at international level allowing wars and building socialism.Of course, it is important that this struggle of the communists is based on a detailed explosion of the historical particularities of this war, as well as of the historical particularity, as regards our country, of the type of role and action that Italy performs in this war imperialist. Because this depends on the tactical and strategic action of the fight against the imperialism, our state, our government.</p>

<hr />
<p>** st. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim notifies cuts up to 900 million in the time, which is completely impossible without a significant deterioration of health services.</p>
<p>St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim is Norway's third largest hospital measured in the number of employees(11.000). Nå forsøker sykehuset å finne «radikale tiltak» for å kuttei utgiftene. Sykehusdirektøren sier de lenge har kuttet litt og litt, men atde nå må «ta strukturelle grep». Adresseavisen skriver at St. Olav ligger antil et underskudd på 256 millioner i 2022, hovedsakelig på grunn avinnføringen av det nye IT-systemet Helseplattformen. St. Olav får strammereøkonomi og enda mer knapphet på personell, i likhet med alle sykehus i landet.</p>
<p>Sykehusdirektøren ved St. Olav sier til Adresseavisen at «Budsjettet for 2023og årene fremover vil bli ekstremt krevende. Vi må følge opp det statsrådensa, og se hva vi kan slutte å gjøre» (3 February). Sykehuset vil forsøke åkutte mellom 570 og 865 millioner kroner. Noen av kuttene kommer som følge avden generelle prisveksten i samfunnet. Ledelsen innrømmer at dette skjer i ensituasjon som allerede er «enormt krevende».</p>
<p>Foretakstillitsvalgt Vivi Bakkeheim, kommenterer saken slik: «De ansatte harmer enn nok med å prøve å komme tilbake til normal drift etter innføringen avHelseplattformen. Om dette vedtas vil det oppleves veldig tungt for deansatte. Det vil heller ikke være mulig å foreta et så stort kutt uten atpasientene vil få et betydelig dårligere tilbud». Adresseavisen skriver ogsåat landets største sykehus, Oslo universitetssykehus, allerede har varsletkutt tilsvarende 500 årsverk og en nedlegging av fødetilbudet ABC-klinikken.</p>
<p>Forråtnelsen i helsevesenet, som nå forsterkes av store kutt og en tiltagendepersonellkrise, er et uttrykk for den allmenne krisa i imperialismen, ogtendensen til å overføre verdier fra velferd til finans, for å øke profittenpå den ene sida, og senke utgiftene til massenes velferd på den andre sida.</p>

<hr />
<p>By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Our comrades in German </strong> <strong> _Dem Volkke Dienen _ </strong> ** have translated an important text from our comrades in Turkey, about the earthquake and the enormous destruction of the destruction.</p>
<p>The earthquake had a strength of 7.7, and has hit many provinces. Although reputation is a natural disaster, the Turkish revolutionary newspaper_partizan_ writes that exploitation and oppression is a direct cause of the extensive scope of destruction and death.</p>
<p>The comrades write that the people face a new major earthquake disaster, and that those who have lost families or have their houses destroyed need solidarity that need to be organized. They write that the authorities have in the beginning the number of people died and the extent of the injuries. Although the quake only lasted seconds, the effect will last for years, the comrades write. They write that politicians will advise to exploit the tragedy in the election campaign, but that the system has nothing to offer people.</p>
<p>Partizan writes that it is not only the nature that is responsible, but that scope disorder is a result of the exaggerated greed of the bourgeois-sufficient system. They point to urbanization, poor buildings and capitalist activities that destroy nature, with erosion and other negative consequences. They write that it is especially the poorest affected, those living in the slums are referred to provisional shelters.</p>
<p>The comrades write: “With this consciousness, it is a revolutionary responsibility to organize solidarity with the people in the regions affected by the disaster, and to organize the people's struggle against the state's hypocritical propaganda rehearsal and solidarity. We encourage all democratic mass organizations and ours organized the power to act with a perspective as organizer solidarity in all our areas »(our translation).</p>
<p>Vi legger til for egen regning, at massene også er spesielt utsatt i de mestkrigsherjede områdene nord i Syria. De imperialistiske krigene har alltidenorme ringvirkninger, blant annet i at de gjør mennesker mer sårbare fornaturkatastrofer.</p>

<p>The protest was born to remember the student who took his life love, inside his university, after not having passed his reprimand of exams.</p>
<p>"A few days ago - they write - a student took his life in Milan, inside his university, after having failed his first exam session. To have failed it was not the student but the university model continues to claim victims, l Yet another death after a few months ago another student took his own life in Bologna, another in Padua and another Annacora in Palermo in the most absolute silence. It is time to break the silence chefinora has cloaked the question of suicides in university. 3 minutes Disconti was the response with which the Rector of IULM tried to diligate this tragedy. By resuming immediately after the regular exam session. Here is what the life of us is valid. Our response is the shape of a body on the ground that Now stain the rectorate of the United. This massacre occurs because the sounds are most subject to stress, immersed in a rhetoric of sticker competition. And to fail i n this university system means seeing the doors of their dreams in the face, and being beaten in the reality of a system that for our generation leaves no perspective, no future if not precarious and exploitationAnd they continue: "Because perhaps behind the story of a student who has failed an examination or did not graduate in time, there is a story a student who makes one or two works, underpaid, precarious, black, all this to stay the Studies, to keep life in another city, to feel adequate. Our task is to stop this massacre, it is to break into silence with the organization of the organization, break the individualism and the culpritization with the strength of an organized community that collectively fights For a viad'sita. For a different system, for a new university, in a newasocity. Tomorrow at 6.30 pm at Palazzo Nuovo. A university assembly will be held. We make the silence break, we start doing it all together. Let's stop Lastrage. Let's join And let's activate to organize an answer. Because this death is not an isolated case but the failure of an inter -system, and then we also want to postpone the university national assembly to be terrified à on 4/5 March in Rome. What we want is a new university model ".</p>

Dr. Naci Görür said, “I say this for the first time, let all Turkey hear it, there are two faults in Turkey. One is the North Anatolian Fault, the other is the Eastern Anatolian Fault. Both emptied most of the two energy. This means that there will be no great earthquake in Turkey in the next few hundred years, at least throughout the Buiki fault zone. However, the places we are worried about between Bingöl İlekarlıova. ”</p>
<p>Speaking to DHA, Görür said, “The situation in Istanbul is not good at all. Just as I wrote 3 days ago, ‘We are concerned about Maraş’, I also worried about Istanbul. All scientific research is that time is coming in Istanbul. It was said that the earthquake was expected in about 30 years.</p>
<p>Prof. Dr. Naci Görür, 3 days ago in relation to the earthquake, the warning that he said, “When the Elazığ earthquake was a statement. Elazığdepremi was on the Eastern Anatolian Fault, that fault awakened. He didn't earthly before. I, ’21. In the century, I would evacuate its energy by producing an earthquake.</p>
<p>“After breaking the Eastern Anatolian Fault Elazığ region, Maraş, Çelikhan, Earlykve Hatay region became a threat,‘ I think that big earthquakes will be in large, ’I said. Now, when a region does not earthquake for a long time, we think that the fault line accumulates a very large extent. Let us say that the people understand, we think that the energy accumulated.</p>
<p>“If a significant energy has accumulated in Maraş, and if you transfer it to an extra energy, we will start to fear Maraş. I said, "Marash" because of that fear and expectation. ‘Earthquake preparations are used, do not neglect the urban transformation here,’ he wrote, drew and said. Unfortunately, February 6 came, there were two earthquakes of 7.7 and 7.6 magnitude. The first earthquake was with ‘triggering’. The fault systems there were each other. The first earthquake was on the Oludeniz fault, the second earthquake was on the Eastern Anatolian Fault. Two earthquakes in such a 9 -hour apart is a very rare one. When we look at it, most of the buildings collapsed like a bowl. ”Stating that the Ministry of Disaster should be established. Dr. Naci Görürsözlerin continued as follows: “First, a disaster ministry will be established. After this ministry, it will have a good budget and the necessary infrastructure and coordination will be made. With 5 years of plans, it will start from earthquake generations and every city in the earthquakes will be transformed into earthquake -resistant cities. First, a Birmikrobeleme work will be done. Risk analysis will be done after the damage to the damage will be done "</p>
