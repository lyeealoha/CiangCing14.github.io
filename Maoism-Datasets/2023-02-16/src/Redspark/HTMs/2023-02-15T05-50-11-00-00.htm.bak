<p><strong>Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan (KAGUMA) | National Democratic Front OfThe Philippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>February 15, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan (KAGUMA) condemns the unjust arrest ofMelania Flores, a professor at the University of the Philippines (UP)Departamento ng Filipino at Panitikan ng Pilipinas and former nationalpresident of the All-UP Academic Employees Union. Flores was accosted byCriminal Investigation and Detection Unit (CIDU) of the Quezon City PoliceDepartment (QCPD) last February 6, 2023, Monday late morning, in her ownresidence inside the premises of the UP Diliman campus in Quezon City.</p>
<p>KAGUMA condemns the concerted campaign of repression orchestrated againstFlores, who was charged with “violating the Social Security Law” for allegedlyfailing to remit social security contributions to her former house helper. Wefind it to be the height of absurdity for the Social Security System (SSS) onits own initiative to go out of its way to file a court case against Floreswhile billions worth of non-remittances by labor-violating companies are leftunchecked.</p>
<p>The PNP agents entered the campus without coordinating with the UPadministration, violating the UP-DILG Accord that prohibits state forces fromentering the UP campus without permission from university authorities. The PNPagents even used a ruse, pretending to be DSWD personnel in civilian clothing,to effect the arrest. All the while, Flores had not even received any subpoenaor notices since the court order was issued last September 6, 2022.</p>
<p>The NTF-ELCAC has since joined the chorus to discredit and besmirch the nameof Flores proving without any doubt the political motivation behind the absurdcharges against Flores. It is clear that the brazen trampling of due processand the rights of Prof. Flores is but the latest fascist attack by stateforces, in order to harass and intimidate progressive teachers and unionists.</p>
<p>KAGUMA calls on the academic community and the Filipino people to push backagainst intensifying fascist attacks on academic freedom and people’s rights.Ultimately, the fascists wish to make an example of the unjust arrest ofFlores as a warning that they can with impunity carry out vicious attacksagainst activists, progressives, and other dissenters.</p>
<p>The fascists intend to terrorize and paralyze patriotic and progressiveeducators and academic workers to stop them from exposing and teaching on thereal oppressed conditions of Philippine society and from linking arms with thewider movement and struggles of workers and peasants across the country.</p>
<p>What these fascists fail to understand is that their machinations are bound tofail as repression pushes more and more people to resist and fight backagainst tyranny and oppression. State terrorism and fascism, also remindspeople of the class character of the big comprador-landlord state and teachesthem a lesson on the necessity of revolutionary collective action.</p>
<p><strong>Defeat the fascist attacks of the US-Marcos regime!</strong>  <strong>Makibaka, Huwag Matakot!</strong></p>
