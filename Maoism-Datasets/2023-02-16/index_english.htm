<p><strong>Bebruary 15, 2023</strong></p>
<p>The Katipunan ng mga RULT MAKAYAN(Kaguma)condemns the unjust arrest ofMelania Flores, a professor at the University of the Philippines(UP)Department of Filipinos in the Pilipinas and Former NationalPresiden of the All-up Academic Employees Union. Flores Was Accosted Bycriminal Investigation and Detection Unit(Cidu)of the Quezon City Police Department(QCPD)last February 6, 2023, Monday late morning, in her ownresidence inside the premises of the UP Diliman campus in Quezon City.</p>
<p>KAGUMA condemns the concerted campaign of repression orchestrated againstFlores, who was charged with “violating the Social Security Law” for allegedlyfailing to remit social security contributions to her former house helper. Wefind it to be the height of absurdity for the Social Security System(SSS)onits own initiative to go out of its way to file a court case against Floreswhile billions worth of non-remittances by labor-violating companies are leftunchecked.</p>
<p>The PNP agents entered the campus without coordinating with the UPadministration, violating the UP-DILG Accord that prohibits state forces fromentering the UP campus without permission from university authorities. The PNPagents even used a ruse, pretending to be DSWD personnel in civilian clothing,to effect the arrest. All the while, Flores had not even received any subpoenaor notices since the court order was issued last September 6, 2022.</p>
<p>The NTF-ELCAC has since joined the chorus to discredit and besmirch the nameof Flores proving without any doubt the political motivation behind the absurdcharges against Flores. It is clear that the brazen trampling of due processand the rights of Prof. Flores is but the latest fascist attack by stateforces, in order to harass and intimidate progressive teachers and unionists.</p>
<p>KAGUMA calls on the academic community and the Filipino people to push backagainst intensifying fascist attacks on academic freedom and people’s rights.Ultimately, the fascists wish to make an example of the unjust arrest ofFlores as a warning that they can with impunity carry out vicious attacksagainst activists, progressives, and other dissenters.What these fascists fail to understand is that their machinations are bound tofail as repression pushes more and more people to resist and fight backagainst tyranny and oppression. State terrorism and fascism, also remindspeople of the class character of the big comprador-landlord state and teachesthem a lesson on the necessity of revolutionary collective action.</p>
<p><strong>Defeat the fascist attacks of the US-Marcos regime!</strong>  <strong>Makibaka, Huwag Matakot!</strong></p>

<p><strong> We reiterate the invitation to the GKN workers' collective to the proletariaticapitalista assembly of next Saturday 18 February in Rome Spazio Metropoz, from 10.30 to 18.30 </strong></p>
<p><strong> We propose to decide together on the 18th a coordinated mobilization of all the factory realities affected by relocation. </strong></p>
<p><strong> clearly we ask the collective, and it is always better, a participation in presence. If really impossible, a telephone connection for a intervention: tel 3475301704 or 335542610 </strong></p>
<p>Factory collective - GKN Florence workers</p>
<p>1 . <strong> Fourth month without salary. </strong> Without thirteenth. The company does not send us the paychecks, the salary coupons, since December. Without gasoline, reach the shifts to carry out the vital activity of custody of the factory emanutation of the factory. 98 Approved injunction decrees. With a cargo bike prototype produced with our hands and a look at the production of renewables. With a public and socially integrated factory project. Without anything, but full of pride and dignity.</p>
<p>2. Borgomeo is preparing for liquidation? Insistent voices multiply. Secosì was, everyone knows about our heads and behind us. If so, this is taking place in spite of any social, contractual, substantial and formal transparency. It would be yet another slap in institutional tables between the social partners. Which should at least make it indignant. Indignation, usually, is a motorcycle of dignity. And alone, it's very little. Mapare that even that little for the institutions is too much.</p>
<p>3 . Yesterday the first two securities in QF took place: from what Checi was said, it was</p>
<p>Pignated an motor robot and an automatic machinery for controlled that called "Vision". Industrial excellence, recent investments, Dindustria 4.0, which lie unused and wasted. The legal action of the vooreers comes to clarify where an entire institutional system of the influence. It's a fact.5 . The right to salary is inviolable. There are no "" remuneration for remuneration windows "with a permanent contract. And it is private private, the company, which must hook a possible shock absorber. If the private entrepreneur - for incompetence or pure negligence any other reason - is not able to hook the shock absorber, pays the risk of business, paying salaries. It is a trivale of the responsibilities that applies to everyone, for us, for you, I do not be Borgomeo and for the Ministry of Labor, evidently. With the invention of the extraordinary retroactive fund, in derogation, in fact, the work of work would sanction that it can be decided in February 2023 as Tueri at work and as you should have been paid in 2022(!!!).</p>
<p>6. Dalle visure, risulta che Pvar è diventata la controllante di Qf/GknFirenze al posto di Plar. Anche se il 23% del capitale sociale della Pvar èdella Plar. Pvar è la seconda società creata da Borgomeo. La prima era Plar,creata nel 2021. Nel maggio del 2022, è stata creata la Pvar. La Pvar sioccupa di "acquisizione di complessi, aziendali qualunque sia il loro oggettosociale, (…)Does the purchase, the exchange, the sale, the construction, the larise of real estate ". The possible liquidation and this changed to the change perhaps allude to a pure real estate operation?</p>
<p>7 . Florence is happening again. As at the Bekaert, as at the Electrolux. Walking now. "But we are still here, eh already!". We can be yet another episode of what has already happened. Or the previous one of what can change. And this is perhaps why they assume us: they do not sit a precedent. And this is the one that is being in this affair. We are playing the salary and the place rampant. You all and all be playing a precedent able to discuss the entire policy of deindustrialization and impoverishment of the delpaese.</p>
<p>8 . Sometimes sieges break. The masks sometimes fall. The truth Avolte manages to arrive before the lie. And sometimes the factory restarts. Public and socially integrated, mutualistic, in line with an ecological true. Maximum solidarity alert, because it is the darkest point. The hardest point which, however, usually precedes the dawn. Solidarity maximum, each in their place in this story.</p>

<p><strong>Kameratene våre i A Nova Democracia skriver om massakren 28. januar, dermilitærpolitiet (PM)killed two farmers and terrorized more than 100 families(300 farmers)In a new attack on the Tiago dos Santos camp in Rondônia. </strong></p>
<p>31 . January gave the Brazilian Association for the People's Lawyers - Gabriel Pimenta(Abrapo)out a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mdOqfEU0y22iq_lFptbWfzUEUzYTFDtx/view?usp=share_link">report</a>and the feder's union(LCP)In the West-Amazonas published a <a href="https://resistenciacamponesa.com/luta-camponesa/policia-assassina-camponeses-durante-ataque-contra-familias/">note</a>About the massacre. The two documents are the cowardly terrorist attacks in this third attack since the soil incompetion began in 2020.</p>
<p>The gruesome massacre, performed by governor, assassin and PM Marcos Rocha, took place in the area of the Tiago Dos Santos camp. Abrapo writes that the wasted owner of this earth is Leme Empredimentos owned by the landowner antônio Martins. "Galo Velho"(the old male), as he is known in the region is mentioned in the _ White Book on Landrøvi_ as one of the largest land thieves in the country. He is being investigated by the civil and federal police and the ministry of public affairs, for financing armed men in the region, for soil theft and peasants.</p>
<p>The brutal attack on peasant families took place during a recapturing action on the Norbrasil farm. On January 28, three PM battalions came with dozens of vehicle and drones. The reactionary military troops shot on three farmers and two dead onturns, hundreds of farmers were physically attacked and the farmers' assets blestjålet. LCP has condemned Marcos Rocha for taking a stand for the soil thieves, and they confirm that the purpose of the operation was to defend the "illegal privileges and interests of Galo Velho".</p>
<p>Also on January 22, an attack was carried out in the same place. According to the LCP, Galo Velho's military driven into the area of a black pickup and skated counter families, unarmed men, women and children. Police shot, threw shock grenades and -thigh gas. Some came along the national highway and others were in ambush.They killed farmers, 34 -year -old Rodrigo Hawerroth(Known as "esticado")and 24 -year -old Daniel Barbosa Laurindo(known as "Mandruvá"), was among the group of farmers who withdrew from the bombs. The group decided to cross the river by boat, but was attacked by the police. Three farmers were shot(In addition to Rodrigo and Daniel, Kennedy was also shot and brought to the hospital). Detre ble tatt levende av politiet og to av dem ble henretta etter alvorligtortur. Abrapo-rapporten påpeker at «bøndene ble torturert, merkene er synligepå kroppene deres, Rodrigo har blåmerker på kroppen og ansiktet som samsvarermed geværkolber, kutt i munnen, et punktert øye og kutt i tunga». Abrapo sierat det ikke er noen sikkerhet for at denne informasjonen vil bli inkludert iobduksjonsrapporten til delstatsregjeringa i Rondônia.</p>
<p>Etter dette angrepet begynte politiet en beleiring av familiene som holdt leiri Barracão das Máquinas, ved gårdens hovedkvarter. Familiene forsøkte å ta segmot elven, men ble stoppa av militæret. Bøndene gjorde motstand og ropte atdet var kvinner, inkludert gravide kvinner, og barn der. Dette ble ignorert avPM (the paramilitary police), which, according to the report, immediately began shooting rubber balls and throwing shock grenades, which also met children and carried the event reactions.</p>
<p>The peasants say the police all carried unidentified uniforms and were followed by armed men from the farm. The leader of the troops, Colonel Lieutenant Pontes, accused the farmers of being a criminal, and the reactionary military said the at the goal was "to kill everyone". Families opposed the attempt to block them inside the single bus, without informing them of the destination, and was then attacked with shock grenades. The families withdrew towards the national road in front of the farm. There had to stop in the roasting sun, without access to water or food. A farmer diapered hospitals due to heart attack, many were injured by rubber balls and fashioned problems with breathing due to tear gas, several fainted.</p>
<p>A few farmers were allowed to pick up a bag of clothes. The rest of the clothes, food, gas bottles, mobile phones, mattresses, medicines and other personal parties were not obtained. Most of the farmers' assets were lying down, all of which were destroyed by the police. The peasants told the lawyers that desa the reactionary military stealing their assets(Mobile phones and money). Politiet forgifta også hunder, forurensa vannbrønner og tok bilder avbøndene.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, January 29, the families left the place and went to Vila Alípiode Freitas, located in the Tiago Dos Santos camp. According to the report, the vice -farmers "great indignation over the executions and the military police's actions to protect the Latifundio".</p>

<hr />
<p><strong> Our German comrades in them Volke Dienen have translated a document divorced farmers' federations(LCP)in Rondonia and West-Amazonas, as the condemnal massacre that was just committed to farmers in the Tiago Campin Dos Santos area. </strong></p>
<p>It was the Special Force Bope who completed the massacre on January 28 in the postage furnace district. Prior to this brutal action, the least three -night farmers were arrested and tortured. One of these was shot in the shoulder and the other, the comrades Estixado and Mandruvá, were tortured to death.</p>
<p>The two killed were unarmed and the bodies were clearly marked by torture, with bruises, wounds and eye injuries. Comrade Esticado(Rodrigo Hawerroth)Had got his tongue reef, and he had been cut up on his face. After these brutal abuses, the security forces attacked families in a nearby camp, where they opened fire and bombs, and destroyed assets and displaced families.</p>
<p>All this reprisal was carried out to expel the poverty farmers to the large landowner Antonio Martin's dos of Santos, a notorious country thief. The governor of the state is a lace for the landlords, and especially Dossantos, writes the comrades in LCP. The bourgeois media covers the incidents, in favor of the landlords, their lackeys, and the security forces.</p>
<p>The comrades in LCP write that their abuses and their clothing will continue the reactionary powers of the revolution in Brazil. But also describe that the guilty must not believe that they can continue their crimes the people unpunished, even today. Millions of farmers are without soil or very small, and the blood that is expelled will be revenged. They write: "We want to answer the same violence, you can be sure!" And "the blood as our folk in the fight does not drown it, it watered our case, makes our flags endaroes, strengthens our class hatred, our determination and our will to fight."</p>

<p>The 187 parliamentarians who voted in favor, Jubilano with the government, and their splashing mouths come out of blood. The Meloni government gives the "gift" of this anti -NGO decree, in front of the sea, to its right electorate. While he uses it as blackmail/pressure towards Europe.

<p>They must bring people saved immediately to a port. But as you are seeing these days these stops become increasingly distant, increasing ignorni of suffering of migrants</p>

The administrative detention is applied for two months to the ship that committed the violation. In the event of reiteration with the same ship, the administrative sanction of the ship's confiscation and the ascertainer body proceeded to the precautionary seizure is applied.</p>

<p>Lenin is extremely clear in tracing the limits of the so -called "warrodifensive", as well as in placing exactly the wars that we now call "liberation" and which must be seen limited to liberationanezionale struggles in the countries oppressed by imperialism.</p>
<p>This also demands a corresponding analysis of the current age of when they were talking about countries oppressed by imperialism, given that the developments and icters that occurred in the imperialist phase have made that many diquest countries have become not countries oppressed by imperialism, but but Paesicapitalisti themselves inserted in the world chain of the systemimperialist and in the international division of labor and development that has always been between capitalist countries and even more there is in the fase of imperialism.</p>
<p>Extending the concept of country oppressed by imperialism leads to extending to countries that have become capitalists albeit employees of the concept of "defense of the homeland", of "defensive war". This produces the collaboration with class to the wars of its country, the subordination of the proletariat of the popular masses to the capitalist bourgeoisie of their country; And the statement in the proletarian and popular ranks of ideology dellanationalism and the abandonment of the struggle for socialism is said to be.</p>
<p>This for example is quite evident in the case of Ukraine. Ukraine is not a country oppressed by imperialism, it is a capitalist country, where capitalism has been restored after the change of Russia. The Russia/Ukraine war, although there was, as in this case, the intervention of all the imperialist powers in dispute with Russia to make the pawn of the imperialist clash, would always be a war between Russian imperialism and Ukraine capitalist. In which the location of the proletariat would still be to fight against aggressor imperialism and against the capitalist bourgeoisie attacked in the country.Therefore, in Ukraine, in the almost totality of the Eastern countries, within the imperialist and capitalists, except rare exceptions, there are no national struggles, and consequently the concept of "defensive war" or "defense of the homeland "It constitutes, as Lenin teaches us, a" historical <em>falsification and only a deception of the simple people by dedadroni</em> ". Indeed, it is on this basis that the bourgeois of these countries servvenide national ideology and of the concept of "defense of the homeland" have brought power of sovereignist regimes, which in substance practice the infascism inside and actively align with the imperialist countries External, participating, and in some cases fomenting, reactionary wars.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> Continuing in the examination of Lenin's writing. </strong> In another step Deltesto "Socialism and war", Lenin writes: "<em>quasi all recognizes the current war is imperialist. But the most deform this concept and Loapplican unilaterally or are looking for to make believe in the possibility of the war has a progressive meaning, of national liberation</em> ".</p>
<p>Lenin continues describing how imperialism is the highest degree of development of capitalism, which has developed all its characteristics at a level embraces, and today even more, most of the countries of the world. It is in this context that gradually extends imperialism, extends to the crimalism within these countries. Which certainly is not the capitalism, it is a sort of deformed capitalism that Maoist Marxistleninist analysis in many cases has analyzed in the form of capitalism, but always capitalism is. And, therefore, there cannot be a progressive capitalism within dependent countries. And the "capitalismoprogressive" line and the alliance with the national capitalist bourgeoisie in senoai dependent countries is a serious deviation that has brought, in particular in the war, the struggles and movements of national liberation to transform themselves, even when they have won, into new ones Initially to state capitalism, in states to capitalism tout court integral part of the imperialistonial system.</p>
<p>So in most cases in these countries the democratic larivoluration has not continued, the revolution of new democracy towards Il Sociaism.It is clear, to return to the underlying theme of Lenin's writing and the nun with today's reality, that these countries become activated by the reactionary wars and rings of the Inter imperialistonial clash.</p>
<p>Lenin takes into consideration the state of affairs in some countries that were oppressed by imperialism in his own, and writes: "<em>in China, Persia and Inindia and in other countries subjects has developed over the past decades of awakening policy to national life of dozens and hundreds of million men, of liberation from the oppression of the great reactionary powers. This historical land a war can also be bourgeoisprogressive today of national liberation</em> ".</p>
<p>Today it is quite clear that in countries like China, Persia(or Iran), India, in no way can we speak of a progressive bourgeois war on national dilibration.</p>
<p>Continuing to support this possibility is class collaboration instead of class struggle within these countries between imperialist bourgeoisie(Chinese)o allied bourgeoisie and strictly linked to the imperialist system, within which the capitalist development continues and in perspective perspective, and working class, poor farmers and exploited masses that have the capitalist bourgeois domination in their country the revolutionary war for the march towards their country Socialism in their country in the world.</p>

<p>Munich Security Conference held every year in Munich(Elbow)This is the 59th time between February 17-19. War lobby from many countries of the world, especially representatives of monopolies who have been the war industry in the world, and especially NATO countries, come together. This conference is a meeting in which the weapon lobby is the continuation of the regional wars in the world and how to marketing these of these. In this year, new war strategies will be discussed and as a result, new attacks on the peoples of Dragon will be planned.</p>
<p><strong> The contradiction between the imperialists is deepening!The imperialist-capitalist system cannot provide a stability in the economic and political field. The existing system cannot intervene in the destruction of capitalism and the form of formation. On the other hand, although the occupation is continued as the solution of the war, each war of occupation raises new problems and deepens the existing ones. While the international market competition of the imperialist states between themselves climbs to the extreme level of the international market competition, hegemony and the geopolitical struggle, the markets of the markets more clarifying the polarizations among the imperialists. And all of them are also an element of threat and attack for the peoples of the world. Buddha shows the reality that imperialism is inevitable in wars as long as it exists._ </strong> ATIK ** _</p>

<p>We have been denouncing the criminal activities of the narco, which Nosolo is responsible for the exponential increase in circulation and consustances - with the predictable deterioration of the health of those who ingest them - also of other insults that cross the social body.</p>
<p>The narco is another of the faces of capitalism, with intimate congurors of the security forces, with members of the Judiciary and Corrupt's Popolitics, with financial and banking corporations and with business sectors.</p>
<p>It cannot be otherwise, despite the doubtful public policies in the field and statements of power, their activities continue to be in full growth.</p>
<p>Corruption of the social fabric, urban violence that originates in the ententing for the control of the distribution networks, squeezes appeals, entrepreneurs and judges, illegal occupation of housing in the neighborhoods, which have plunged the population in a condition of inermity(1)And helplessness, adding one more reason that ends up affecting mental health.</p>
<p>To this we must add the effects that these situations produce on the mental representation systems of the community. It is known that narco institutions are producers of culture, which splicing with the culture consumist gestate what we have conceptualized as "toxic culture."</p>
<p>The point is that this construction alienates people's brain, legitimizing and promoting substance consumption. Hence, we still attend increased social tolerance towards consumption, and a decrease in the social perception of risk that they imply.While they are tiny groupings, and that those who oppose we are high service of the ruling classes. Mechanism that operate in the large urban centers, particularly in the areas of greater poverty and exclusion, places where consumption are vests dressed to castrate the potential of rebellion of the kids and kids of those barrads.</p>
<p>The consumption of chemical substances alter the registration systems of lareality and with it the possibility of elaboration and a practical formator, which challenges a class society that oppresses, excludes and exploits the majorities.</p>
<p>Hence the vital importance of facing these drug trafficking, and toxic culture, with the power that popular forces deploy when organizing after necessary objectives. To the toxic culture we must oppose culture that springs from the solidarity, cooperation and commitment of Lamayoria.</p>
<p>Overcoming this situation involves operating at three interdependent levels:It is how we agreed one day with Carlos del Frade, democratize democracy, put it at the service of common people, transform it into a social Latin transformation ram.</p>

<p>To the press and to the public</p>
<p>In the Hasankoca cemevis of Pazarcık district of Maraş, it is an unacceptable attitude to intervene in the aid collection and distribution center established for the earthquake victims by the district governorship and law enclosure and to prevent a humanitarian activity for democratic mass organizations.</p>
<p>Especially the fact that the public is appointed by the governor's assignment by the governor's assignment by trusting and consent of the heart with the consent of the heart.</p>
<p>It is very valuable for both important and hope for the demaks to exhibit material and moral solidarity by showing serious sensitivity, not only domestic, not only in domestic, but also in the major earthquake disaster causing serious destruction and tram in our country.</p>
<p>We never accept and condemn all kinds of interventions to reach the aids who are required to be distributed to the AFADEREZ, which are desired to be distributed by these institutions to Alevi institutions and branches from abroad and to the AFADmerkezi, and to convey all kinds of human, emergency and vital aids to your people.</p>
<p>It is intervened in the will of the will to intervene and to intervene in these centers by ignoring the unity and urgency of aid and solidarity of vital aid and solidarity in regions where the state cannot reach. It is a violation of human rights and a crime.</p>
<p>We demand that the people's solidarity spirituality be interrupted and that solidarity is not prevented in order to inform the pain in this painful process with the earthquake victims.</p>
<p>We invite the state to do their original duties. We recommend the government and the state to use its energy and power to solve the most urgent problems of our people, not in preventing the distribution of humanitarian aid. Don't forget; Solidarity.</p>
