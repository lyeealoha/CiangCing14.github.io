LET 'S DEVELOPE THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST WORLDWAR PREPARATIONS! 
--DECLARATION--
All the imperialist countries proclaim to be defenders of freedom, democracyand world peace. They all pretext to fight against dictatorships andinternational terrorism. But, indeed, they are the worst te\rrorist dictatorsin the world. They speak about peace but frantically prepare for a new war ofglobal robbery. They strengthen the arms industry. They increase theirarsenals. They mobilize huge war machines mainly towards Eastern Europe. Theysponsor the already prolonged wars against the peoples of Palestine, Syria,Yemen. They are inciting the outbreak of new reactionary wars in the TaiwanStrait, on the Korean peninsula, in the East China Sea, on the Ukrainian-Belarus border, on the sea border between Greece and Turkey. NATO, commandedby Yankee imperialism, in Ukraine through the puppet regime of Kiev, confrontsits mercenary armies, weapons and military chiefs, with the military might ofRussian imperialism. Both sides concoct pretexts to use nuclear weapons. Theinter-imperialist contradictions sharpened to the point that a new nuclearworld war is no longer a latent imperialist danger, but an imminent risk forthe existence of world society and its habitat.
BasicallyThe ongoing proxy wars and trade wars, the emerging trade blocs andmilitary blocks, allotment of heavy military budgets, manufacturing colossaland mass destructive weapons, modernizing military forces and several types ofpreparations for world war even in space shows the neck and neck competitionfor the economic resources and political control over the countries of Asia,Africa and Latin America including several east European countries. All theseindicate the intensifying inter-imperialist contradictions and the scramblefor the re division of markets and world hegemony.But the same economic and social causes that push the imperialists to wars ofrobbery, become unlivable, unbearable material conditions for the slaves ofcapital, material conditions of the rebellion of the exploited proletarians,peoples, nations and countries oppressed by the monopolies and imperialistcountries. And it is up to the International Communist Movement to bring themthe revolutionary conscience, organize and transform the rebellions into arevolutionary struggle against the common enemy: the world capitalist systemof oppression and exploitation.
Com. Mao says that: 'World war may break out and revolutions may occur as aconsequence, or, revolutions may breakout everywhere and while confining itsstrength to with stand them, it may become impossible for imperialism toundertake another world war, whichever way it occurs this is as era ofrevolution'.
It is up to the communists to give an example of internationalist unity andstruggle against the preparations for a new imperialist world carnage; joinand coordinate efforts to promote the revolutionary struggle of theproletarian armies in all countries against the mobilization of troops andweapons for reactionary wars; construct a common front with all therevolutionaries, the anti-imperialist, democratic and environmentalist forcesthat oppose the war and the support and military commitment of the lackeyregimes with their imperialist masters across the world especially in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries; reject and denounce as traitors theopportunist satraps who, in the name of the proletariat and the peoples, givesupport to one of the imperialist factions, when they are all deadly enemiesof the oppressed and exploited of the world; relentlessly support therevolutionary struggle led by genuine Marxist-Leninist-Maoist communists,mainly the people's war in India together with other people's wars inPhilippines,Turkey,Peru, today are the vanguard of the World ProletarianRevolution, against imperialism and its reactionary national watchdogs.
Imperialist capitalism is in crisis!Long live Socialism and Communism!
Or the revolution stops the war or the war unleashes the revolution!
Workers and peoples of the world, unite against imperialism!

PC February 11: The Meloni government precarises work: liberalization of fixed -term contracts and unpaid extraordinary

From an anti -capitalist proletarian assembly February 11, 2023 ## Pisa delegates and independent workers The Meloni government, after the San Remo Festival which for decades has actually effectively on public opinion, will bring a decree to Parliament.
We have had some advances in the decrees already approved with the voucher of the voucher, now with a special amendment to the milleproproghe we come knowledge of the desire to go beyond 24 months for the inter -two.
The Conte government had had at least the merit, in the first seasonal season of grillism, to introduce not only the RDC, albeit with a thousand limited imperfections that we have never hidden for the other,
But he also had posts for the use of flexible contracts.
The principle was in itself right, indeed it should be the leading principle of trade union action, i.e. a state intervention to limit the precarious aticontrated appeal in order to encourage indefinite time.
The Meloni government, after years of accusations to the EU of wanting to demolish the work, today marries the classic neo liberal line which is then the economic theory that the sovereignty.
All the roofs are removed to encourage the appeal to precarious contracts and Siinizia right from the interdinal, introduced in Italy by the center left with Treu package, and then moved on to the assault of the Dignity decree that the appeal repeated to fixed -term contracts.
An intermine agency, after 24 months, should have taken on a temporary, if the umpteenth extension will pass(Almost certain sight I leave a majority in Parliament)Instead, it will be possible to exceed 24 months with fixed -term contracts.
The extensions and derogations from measures that limit the use of contracts have occurred both for Covid and to keep silent the opposition of the employer associations, now the government begins the progressive dismantling of a few rules that at least tried to limit the appeal to the contracts by establishing limits temporary.
And from the intermination we will move on to fixed -term contracts to be able to be a blade in other work measures. The classic ethical of neoliberalism, the work to be created is the precarious that of the companies but feeds the spiral downwards of the wages he grabs the protections as a whole.Since its inception, the Dignity decree underwent ferocious attacks that brought limitation of fixed -term contracts to 3 years compared to the twoinials, then other derogations arrived.
The Meloni government aims to destroy the causals, indeed to delete them for fixed -term iconders in the first two years and in this way it will consent to the dictates of the companies, the exact opposite of what happens in some countries such as Spain.
And always in these days we learn how the use of the extraordinary Siamempre most widespread to confirm that new jobs are not built.
Let's find out that a good part of the exceeding hours, extraordinary, do not pay, can be seen from a recent report:
Inapp, employment: unpaid extraordinary for a worker out of six. But it is the tip of the iceberg: half of the employees works at antisocial times.

Yet another fire in Borgo Mezzanone 
After Queen and Ibrahim's death on the night of January 23, days ago in Borgomezzanone a fire broke out that destroyed a shack. Although glialbitants of the former track have called for help, these are not pigs on. The person who lived there lost the house and the documents that there austle and is currently in the hospital because his hand has burned and wounded part of the face. This is everyday life for those who live in these assignments, especially in winter where in the settlement of Borgo Mezzanone 'electricity skips every two hours and it is impossible to find a way to perscade. But this has been known to all for a while, despite the fact that the paradi-institutional and para-institutional parades come only when Ilmorto escapes us.
The solution because nobody lives and dies in these conditions is to allow kettuts they have documents and consequently they can also have a home. He is not to understand him, and who silences and represses the struggles of those who ask for this daughter is an accomplice of this system of death and exploitation. Now stop
Campaign workers Committee Borgo Mezzanone: We know who it was, your hands down from those who live neighetti. 
As always happens in these cases, the first reactions to the news of yet another death in a ghetto are
disbelief and dismay. Those who live in these conditions know very well that lasual life is hanging by a thread, and that it could happen to anyone to die as a time has touched Queen and Ibrahim(Soldier for friends), intoxicately fumes of a brazier they used to warm up.This does not mean, however, that those who live in a ghetto undergo in silence, nor make themselves exploitation as often as often as associations, unions and parties of the They have been carrying out independently for years - hindered by those stessics today present themselves as friends and supportive ones.
Thats enough!Let's not forget, let's not forgive. Houses, documents and contracts Perttt*!A hug to the families and friends of those who are gone today. Restin Power.

 The Lombardy of the imperialist bourgeoisie that of the transformed pandemic, of the crisis where profits and people under the painting threshold increase, which now clings with the war economy downloaded on the proletaricon precarious work, deaths at work, private health, increase in hospitality and the corporal, pollution and devastation of the territory.
With Fontana/Salvini who also announce the possibility of a center -off to give energy and defend the owners' economy.
While the Democratic Party on the one hand defends the sending of weapons of the Meloni government as a "painful necessity" and on the other it speaks of opening a diplomatic path UsataCome Electoral Propaganda for reconstruction.
 Despite what the beautiful ex -CGIL souls like Mario Agostinelli say(Porto Alegre-Social Forum), it is not with the vote in Majorino that he puts himself in the greedy of the war and in our opinion not even a popular union with his candidate for the regional Ghidorzi who professes himself "radical, but nonideological", when the problem is precisely ideological: also because there is no It can be peace and social justice without "destroying classes and building iliesocism" and therefore without the war of the oppressed against the oppressors, so the problem is not only no to NATO.
The problem is not the defense or improvement of the European "democratic" system but the worker and popular mobilization against the government of the war defends the interests of the Italian imperialist masters, Leonardo, Eni, etc.From the press:
Ukraine, Europe and the arms lobby of Pierfrancesco Majorino 
I think we should insist on the political and diplomatic path as that explicitly "desperate" that career to earn a respite, to start anprocess of peace and proceed, one day, towards reconstruction
Putin's war is producing death and destruction. The invasion to which he is much more a much more
"senseless" conflict: it is a road without return destined to change lastoria. The actions implemented so far by the Community, starting from a powerful system of sanctions, perhaps still from Dainasperto, have represented a significant choral response and as many can affirm for that painful necessity consisting of some reforms, weapons and defense tools, to the Ukrainian people. Just that of that is demonstrating an extraordinary and certainly underestimated ability to resist.
\ -------
To the vote a Lombardy weapons and Lancia head of the right 
Mario Agostinelli on the Manifesto
The war, because the society and the economic structure of Lombardy, located a military and above all nuclear Arsenal, as well as of the most nourishor of aerospace military production and light weapons, have not been foreign. Here Leonardo has seven production units of helicopters, aircraft, drones for wars. In terms of turnover it is the first impressive in the EU. It sells hunting for Saudi Arabia, to take massacres of Civiliy Yemen, while Agusta helicopters are used by Turkey against ICurdi. One wonders: what are we sending from here to Ukraine, since they are secreted to him?
F35 Cacciabombardieri are deployed in Ghedi(Brescia)For the hatred of 40 B61-12 thermonuclear bombs to replace the B61-3 and 4. Lenuove bombs are the first nuclear weapon adaptable to different yields, from 0.3 to 50cilotons and can have both tactical use, and getting to explode under the surface surface Earth with an equivalent surrender to 83 Hiroshima bombs.
\ -------
The example of the Leonardo, Studio Prometia 2022: 
In Lombardy the supply chain created value for 2.7 billion and 30 thousand occupied On the other hand, making the gaze to the production ecosystem of Lombardy, the company is described as "the fulcrum of a supply chain that overall it to the regional GDP with approximately 2.7 billion euros, equal to 0.8%of the total(+28% compared to 2018)". The value, reads the dossier, brings the Lalombardia to the top of the ranking in Italy by incidence on the GDP produced Alivello Regional by Leonardo and every euro of added value Created to the company generates, on average, two additional euros in the area.
Perfume(to Leonardo): "Committed to enhancing the production ecosystem"
"We are constantly committed to improving the tools to enhance the production ecosystem of the territories where we operate, concentrating, Intremis, on the development of a long -term sustainable supply chain capable of supporting the occupational growth, skills and innovation of the entire home system: The initiatives of Leonardo Asostegno of the supply chain are competitive levers for the benefit of the country development of the country, "said Alessandro Profumo, Leonardo's director of Leonardo.(Mario Agostinelli The beautiful soul of the Social Forum Eportoalegre)The Prometia 2022 studio on Leonardo
From the results of the Prometia 2022 study it emerges how 10 employed by Leonardoain Lombardia support, on average, an additional 33 additional employees for an inscription of 30 thousand employees of the local ecosystem, a value grown by 30%compared to 2018. The region is also the one in which the value of the company's research & development activities is greater, reaching 382 million euros, equal to 9.6% on a total regional basis.
In the region, the group is present with six main locations, between Varese, Brescia and Nerviano - active in the business of helicopters, aircraft, electronics and cybersecurity - for over 7,000 employees employed; thanks to the presence of Leonardo, the Lombardy territory It is among the few Almondo to be able to boast a complete velivol capacity, both in the fixed wing in the rotating wing, as well as advanced skills in the spatial field.
Leonardo's value for ItalyCompared to 2018, the study underlines how the total impact of the Grupp activities on the Italian economy has grown by 18%, in terms of value -produced value, and 16%, in terms of employed: the result is the result of the expansion of direct activities of the group and purchases at the Italian Lapropum Chain chain.
Spada: "Aerospace strategic sector for the whole territory"
"Aerospace plays an important role in our territory, thanks to an industrial unechosystem made of supply chains, relationships with companies and universities, cutting -edge technologies, research and development investments, attention sustainability". Alessandro Spada, president of Assolombarda, said it, on the sidelines of the event "The supply chain of the Airospace, Defense and Security Inlombardia", organized by Assolombarda, Confindustria Lombardia and Leonardo, in collaboration with Lombardy Aerospace Cluster.
"Just think that the Leonardo group, in Lombardy, contributes to 0.8 %of GDP, with over 30 thousand employed if we consider the supply chains - continued -. These data testify to the weight of the aerospace and are the reason because it must be considered as a sector Strategic for the country. Furthermore, by being an industry that, together with its supply chains, represents a fast for the entire production ecosystem in terms of innovation, an essential element of the competitiveness and health of a country ".

By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.

A debate at NRK recently showed the bourgeois economy bankruptcy again. Economists met for debate, and found itself fundamentally disagreeing whether the economic policy the government leads will succeed. 
Martin Holm, postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Economics at UiO, the cuts claimed the ice budget has little effect on price growth, and that these may be canceled it from 5.9 percent to 5.8. He stated that people are getting worse conditions due to a price growth due to impulses from the world market, and that there is little Norwegian authorities can do with this.
Chief economist at Sparebank 1 Markets, Harald Magnus Andreassen, stated that one thing is known in the economics subject: "Nothing is certain". The Andreassen raises the economy does not have laws and regulations such as physics, because it is a community subject. Nevertheless, he believed that Martin Holm was wrong, using more money will have major consequences, and that inflation will increase more about the government's consumption.
After a longer debate, chief economist Jan Ludvik Andreassen from the Eika Groupe came in the debate, and referred to the economic policy as "madness". He said the 2 per cent at 2 per cent from Norges Bank is randomly chosen, that it is foreseen, and that one must accept higher inflation. He said that there is no inflation with inflation up or down, that prices are increasing because of the war, and that one needs an economic crisis to counteract this.
At the same time, LO's chief economist felt that Norges Bank should not set up interest rates. He bametric authorities be confident that the trade union movement will be responsible for the processing negotiations, and thus prevent wage growth from becoming too high. This ergan revealing about what function LO has in the Norwegian bourgeois community. All economists also agreed that higher interest rates mean higher unemployment, and thus this is a probable result in the future. Reference _ 19 . Jan. - Believes the animal time is unnecessary _

PC February 11: the 100 days of the Meloni government and ours what to do

 The 100 -day balance of the Meloni government shows what this government is, lasual continuity with previous governments, and in particular with the Draghie government its specificity, difference.
On the war the weapons sent, the funds allocated and removed from the health, to the school, to work, to the social supports have reached very high figures; Draghisicuramente had started, but the Meloni government in his miserable desire to prove himself faithful and more "realistic of the king" towards the US/born and not to make aside from other countries in Europe, he went on like a train, he added to weapons the fascist identity sign, proposing to propose training to the use of weapons in schools and the Russian the restoration of the compulsory elevation;
Meloni and his ministers, primarily Crosetto, have become tireless deiviators/piazzisti, to exchange weapons, support for regimes, such as Libya, and the lives of migrants with business, and profits in North Africa, especially for Eni.
In economics there has been continuity in the download of the economic crisis, the effects of the imperialist war in Ukraine and energy crisis on the Professor and the popular masses, with further attacks on wages, work conditions, jobs and unemployment, school, health, social services ; continuity in giving money, billions to companies, especially to the great emanie, while they continue to put in cassintegration, to fire, asphruct the life, the bodies of the workers and workers, and while Isalari are not enough even for the need 'Vitali, and the newpovers increase. But this government has clearly gone further: reducing the miseiary income of citizenship to the maximum, vulgarly attacking the unemployed, the poor, eliminating any worsening of the employment relationships desired and done by the DaPadroni
But the characteristic of this government is not the economy, but it is the actions, leconceptions from modern fascism.As the nationalism/sovereignty of some ministries era revaluation in all forms of fascism on the front of ideology, culture, is gradually more evident.
Still under trace, in propaganda and above all in the concrete action it is against the right of abortion, to have children and children for capital and lapatria, for the legal recognition of the fetus, etc. But the most dangerous sound signs. The clerical-fascist aspect, in the name of 'god-spader-family', will be clear and clear on the front of the rights and freedoms of naive women.
Just as we are still to the statements, to the proposals on the repayment/upheaval of the Constitution and on the presidentialism, but also this to the words will soon follow the facts.
Each story is then transformed into "hands on institutions", as the casedonzelli/Delmastro showed, a serious story because it is an expression of unarotture of the rules of the parliament and the articles of the Constitution, inside a creeping coup. He is killed by the dialectic -parliamentary and shows that this government is reactionary in the contents but what is underway is IlModerno Fascism.
But clearly the top is reaching on the question of justice, of the hands on the judiciary and repression, which sees the Alfredo Cosenza/41bis case as a tip; On this, Min. Nordio, Avallatodalla Meloni, expresses his reactionary humus not so much in the decisions that, as in the declarations that accompanies them. The 41bis put previous hygitters but today this government considers terrorist thread also Chiva to visit so that.
All aspects are visited by the government and place the need for a general a general, in which, however, the horizon of the forces is inadequate.
In this sense, the speeches of those who hide fascism, who insists on directors are the same thing, are a disaster.
Fascism is not the same thing in bourgeois democracy, it is in the bourgeois democracy cordella, but it is the most extreme tip. We are "children" of Gramsci who openly made the battle against ilphascism. And even now the communists must put their face on it.
The hill of the reaction is basically united and has a more reference, compared to the governments of Berlusconi or Lega. Rozzi, unwatched, molded bodies with respect to the representation of their straight sectors.Our enemy is economism. For example, on the war, the idea that Daglieffetti can be traced back to the causes is an economic and stupid idea. Lalotta against the caravan is done with ordinary instruments, with the struggle peraments wage, first of all(But there is no light on this, there is no comparison with mobilizations in France or England). Lo stesso valesull'"autonomia differenziata", che oggi viene posta in cambio delpresidenzialismo, ma è il presidenzialismo l'obiettivo. E il presidenzialismonel nostro paese è sempre stato sinonimo di dittatura aperta, personale, cheanticipa le leggi che lo consolidino come regime.
In questa situazione non c'è alternativa alla denuncia, all'azione diminoranza che si ponga come riferimento per le masse. Deve crescere ladenuncia politica, la chiarezza politica. Il valore rappresentato da come cistiamo organizzando è la nostra vera forza, di piccolo gruppo che a spiraleinfluenza il movimento reale.
Dobbiamo rafforzare il lavoro verso le fabbriche, i settori proletari epoveri, organizzando e collegando le lotte come arma di riorganizzazioneproletaria, di sottrazione del consenso al governo, di brodo di coltura dellalotta politica contro il governo. Su questo i nemici sono i collaborazionisti col governo, sindacaticonfederali. Mentre gli amici ambigui sono il sindacalismo di base riformista,economicista. La nostra risposta è la centralità operaia, il sindacalismo di classe,l'assemblea proletaria anticapitalista.
Sul fronte della guerra l'aspetto principale è l'agitazione e propagandapolitica. Mozione operaia e proletaria da far sottoscrivere e approvare inassemblee; manifestazioni, da piccole a grandi, contro governo, Ministeridella guerra, industria bellica, Basi militari. I nemici qui sono il fronte della pace, i filo ucraini-Zelensky, e come sempregli economicisti. Gli amici ambigui sono i filo Russia, filo Cina, gli anarchici essenzialmenteantimilitaristi. In critica a queste posizioni, affermiamo senza ombra didubbio che la Russia di Putin è un paese capitalista-imperialista e dittaturafascista, la Cina è un paese socialimperialista.
Diamo il massimo sostegno ai movimenti di lotta, al movimento delle donne, aimovimenti e azioni antifasciste e antirazziste, settori studenteschi cherispondono con azioni e lotte. Nemici sono i partiti parlamentari, associazioni e personalità ad essi legati. Amici ambigui il femminismo piccolo borghese, i sostenitori della "nonviolenza".

Them Vikke Dienen writes about actions for IKF and for TKP/ML's martyrs.
Activists from TKP/ML have welcomed the foundation of the International Communist Association - IKF welcome with an action in Istanbul. A banner was hung up Vedavcılar Metrobus street where TKP/ML congratulates IKF's members and encouraging the responsibility and work.
 In addition, partizan comrades performed as part of the week to the party and the martyrs of the revolution. In Istanbul, the comrades organized march at Sarıgazi Gravlunden, where Mehmet Demirdağ, the party's fourth -general secretary is buried. On the way to the burial ground, camaraderie shouted as "the guerrilla never dies, long live the war!" And "Our leader Eribrahim Kaypakkaya!".
 Turkish police attacked the memorial ceremony of the party's martyrs and the revolution and gathered rebel police at the burial ground. Six partizan comrades became a police attack with massive violence. They were attacked with pepper spray, placed on the tombs and handcuffed. Despite this, the comrades ran the memorial mark and struck back police attacks.
 The arrested comrades reported through their lawyers that they were warned at Sancakpe police station and that they were put in front of the paw in the map anadolu courtroom the next day.

Communists' Federation was formed in London on June 1, 1847, by a merger of the federation of Karl Schaper and Communist correspondence committee in Brussels, where Marx and Engels were leading members. "Proletaries in all countries, unacculted you!" As a slogan, new name and a complete reorganization of the Righteous Association under this new name. This meeting considered the first congress in the Communist's Federation. Engel's blade secretary in the central leadership, and Karl Schappper became leader.
The union's second congress, late that year, gave Marx and Engels in the task of the Communist Party's manifesto, known as the Communist Manifesto. Both of the two major revolutionary leaders were central to the new association.
The Communists' Federation is a milestone in the organization of the International Proletariat: For the first time, it constituted itself as a communist party. The Federation was international, with members and departments in many countries. The Association was cland -stitched with strict secrecy.
The union quickly met anti -communist persecution. Revealed members bleed and laid off, and the union was dissolved after the anti-communist case in Cologne in 1852. There, 11 suspected communists were stated for the court, for participation in the 1848 revolution, and 7 of them were sentenced to up to 6 years in prison.
Equally, the communists' union was of enormous ideological, political and organizational importance. The Communist Manifesto is still a single -known program for the world's communists. The union's organization for inspiration to this day is also.
We want to highlight two characteristic features of the union's organization: The first it was internationally. Its departments were not autonomous, the menstrual menstrual crossed borders and countries, with obligations and a central management. Secondly, from the first moment they were organized for illegality, also, among other things, as a requirement for members "that one does not reveal anything the existence or affairs of the union".We encourage our readers to study these statutes, and the general history of the Communists' Association. For us, this has a special significance today, where the news of the foundation of the International Communist Association Runnerverden around.

 There are many weeks when artists' mobilizations continue(Students and Employees), being a thorn in the government, which as far as it refuses to satisfy their demands. With a question in question of PD85(A diastle on the State's maiden, which is not only about artists), but also a situation that has been deepening here, the movements on the part of students and workers are escalating.
The many years of precaritation, volatility, hunger wages - a reality that are well and those who go to study - have taken the world of artistic roads with many opportunities during the Lokdos period. Even with the cause of the arts censorship. Now the PD85, which squeezes down their troops, was the drop that overflowed the glass.
For many more weeks than they would probably expect, the ODIADIES themselves, in Athens and Thessaloniki has created a acquis: weekly marches with significant mass in both cities. Especially if one is basically demonstrating the space of the arts, without a wide -ranging of other portions of people and youth, then the importance of these figures other heights. And this is only about the crowd that demonstrates. The escalation of movements by demonstrators is also the way.However, and despite the intense collective and claiming procedures that are being carried out, they remain specific problems that characterize the oral movement. While workers' unions are involved, they seem to have some difficulty in moving if they do not "pull" the protesters. This has to do with both the chronic inaction of their leaders and their bourgeoisie. For example, there are there are constant talks with PDs, ministries and other politicians of the system, in essence, in essence, saying that these matters is the main field of claim. At the same time, despite the decisions of the Associations and Associations, their leaderships do not gather members to go down the mobilizations, while on the other hand, they are in a poor manner, such as The KKE Constables, which with its well -known "Student Associations' decisions" lowered dozens of members. Requests are dominated by the modification of the PD so that it includes artists or the proposal in the system on how to form artistic education in the country.

 Starting with the most blackmailed part of the industry, the government begins to deprive individual evaluation. Specifically, the formal process of hosting two years after the appointment for the newcomers, is convened in a vehicle for the passage of individual assessment, through the fact that it makes their individual assessment mandatory prerequisite for their accommodation. The industry is alarmed and angry for yet another administration, an anger that has forced trade union leaders to call on, on strike and on strike-to-beard from individual assessment(Although the latter has limited momentum in this phase, where blackmailing is essentially called to fight the battle).
Οι ηγεσίες στις ΟΛΜΕ–ΔΟΕ κάνουν ότι δεν καταλαβαίνουν ότι η φύση της επίθεσηςαπαιτεί συγκρότηση κεντρικής μάχης κόντρα στην πολιτική αυτή. Κεντρική μάχησημαίνει: α) Mass General Assemblies To be able to participate in the race in the race, to break the logic of assignment, b) Demonstrations To make up teachers in body and voice that deals and resists and does not negotiate with those who are supplied, c) Strikes Why the above are left unhappy without the strike. Because this is how the workers have conquered the right time.
Given the correlations to OLME-DOEs and the goals of the basic strengths there, the federations have no intention of fighting this battle. Their 'ambitions'(of 'opposition' at least)They reach a slight government deterioration of the government and the relief of indignation to electing their body. With this, it seems even bigger the gap left by the lack of primary ELME and SEPA unions, which, through massive consensus, must form this battle. In the same context, traders have to activate all weapons and tools. Establish from the General Assemblies COMMITTEES OF RACE Messengers for interventions in schools and organization of the race. to be activated or made - where there are no - strike funds for the economic support of the race.At the same time, the forces(Even out of the communion)They insist on underestimating the depth of the attack, through assurances of "perfectly legitimate forms of struggle" and other illusions that do not help to form the struggle to be. It would not be an exaggeration to say that some of the forces that supported suggestions OLME-DOE from within are waiting for them(or maybe they wish)Strike strikes and strike/abstinence illegal, so that it has OKLADO ... "beat" again and walk in the elections.
Despite the political difficulties, the industry is opposed to the attacking assessment. The overall deterioration of the work conditions and the pilgrims who disappear in a few days also form a decisive confrontation with what the evaluation brings and which are perceived by educators.
If the OLME-DOE leaders want to do a strike and unravel, it must with its mass participation to impose immediate and escalation of mobilizations.
With basic goals:
-The direct and unconditional construction of the newly -built
-The overturning of the evaluation
-The real increases in wages
With organizational measures that will trigger teachers, with commissions and coordination between ELME and SEPA. In forms of struggle that will get out of the classrooms, with strikes and mass demonstrations.
Without illusions about legal forms of struggle and "struggles" without any kind of kind, without electoral illusions and pre -election paralysis, teachers can give the necessary struggle.
The success of the strike and demonstrations on February 15 is critical for how and how this race will evolve. The fighters and the fighters are in the racing movements of teacher, as they gave the battle to massive general assemblies, so they will decisively give the success of the strike and demonstrations. And with the same firmness they will fight so that 15 February is not the end, but the beginning of a great struggle.

 Since last summer we have entered a constant pre -election period with a characteristic of… constantly leaking dates but are being detached from reality, to… leak new, keeping constant anxiety and permanent pre -election activity and fermentation both the political personnel and the mentioned left.
Many attribute the delay in calling for election to the so -called simple proportional election(with a 3%ceiling, so as not to forget)that SYRIZA had voted for and that this is short -circuited the "next day" as it creates problems for a self -sufficient government in the service of the local ruling class and the imperialist rulers.
And if the American imperialists were the ones who put ice in Mitsotakia elections last fall as the war conflicts in the inkraine were exacerbated and demanded complete commitment and alignment to their debt, they were the European imperialists who were so farmers. Mitsotakis and in every direction that they are not intended to downgrade the role and the dominant dominant in the country and the region, upsetting the bourgeois politician about where the developments will lead.
Let's be clear. It is not the electoral system - that many, in their revivalist delusions, consider it a "opportunity" - to delay the announcement of the election date, is not much more so, the electoral system is not the electoral system that determines the critical election. The criticality of the upcoming elections arises from the political controversy of the period both for the system as a whole and for its cultural representatives and the people. Each for different and opposite reasons.
At a time when the attack on the system of exploitation, oppression and imperialist dependency is manifested by waves in life and tadms of the working people and youth, even today it is supposed to have a "relaxation" due to a pre -election period, it is revealed that it may be revealed. Politics is a permanent choice of "all -and -white".But even this anti -labor -anti -populist politics, along with the slavery and intensity of dependency, are not enough to satisfy the aspirations of the local ruling class and the imperialist rulers.
On the one hand it requires the full subjugation of the working people and nenia so that it is an easy choice to load on their backs the "broken" of the crisis and the deadlock of the local system. To self -establish fascism, the suppression of strikes and mobilizations, anti -labor -anti -unionist laws are fully implemented, so anti -communist propaganda is strengthened and legal regulations are prepared.(allegedly)They will prevent today and in the future will rest those who refer to the Left and the Communist Movement, who are not subject to civil legitimacy.
This reactionary policy finds the reaction of the people, who is facing the expansion of capitalist precision that brings about infliction and misery to large parts of it. Despite the fact that many of us in the area of the left do everything they can to keep their racing outbursts and mobilizations, it is certain that the people and the youth are not willing to sacrifice the interests of the local system of the local system. of his imperialist protectors. And this is a major obstacle to the aspirations of the system's potential, inside and outside the country.
On the other hand, strengthening the bonds of imperialist dependency today by US-NATO also has its "Avaries" as the side of the imperialists requires stability in NATO's southeastern wing in a periodic period of war-clasing in Ukraine. He signifies that steps of temporary or more medium -term compositions in the Aegean, Cyprus, in the Southeast Mediterranean should be taken. These "understanding", however, remove the territory of Turkophagia on which the current policy of the ND government is set and it is certain that they will create serious friction inside it.If for the bourgeois and imperialist staffs, their focusing focuses of a powerful anti -populist government for the people and youth is difficult and critical as they have to decide whether they will receive false dilemmas of "rescuers"(Say with SYRIZA)or 'repentant' systemic(Say me with day 25)Either they will choose the path of organizing, resistance, claiming and the confrontation with the forces of system.
On this road they will encounter significant obstacles that will have to be overcome, as there are excess of the electoral and parliamentary illusions that scattered the KKE and on the other of the extra -parliamentary Left.(ANTARSYA, LAE et al.). Από τη μία το ΚΚΕ, έχοντας μπει σε προεκλογική τροχιάεδώ και μήνες, με προοπτική να κινείται στην ίδια τροχιά μέχρι τον επόμενηΟκτώβρη (self -administration)And having declared a movement of movement, he promotes the "government power program" in search of the "gap" of kinematic reformism previously SYRIZA. On the other hand, in the elections for the extra -parliamentary left, they re -recycle the "transitional programs" that collapsed in the summer of 2015, to find points of contact with each other that does not even meet on the road.
In these conditions the intervention of the KKE(ML)Currently both with the proposal of coordination and joint action of organizations and colleges stanked fronts of struggle and with the proposal for Pan -Hellenic anti -war joints in February against the unjust war in Ukraine, the Tonadritis competition of the local bourgeoisie of the Greek bourgeoisie. The US - NATO, for the friendship and solidarity of thelas, are our contribution to the development of the terms of movement as a Timonian outlet for the labor -popular forces to the challenges of the weather.

 A tourist tour in the Middle East, with controversial targets, made UPEX of the US, Blinken, on January 29th. The cause of the US attempts to alleviate the tensions and rise of violence between the new Israeli government and the Palestinians. The tour started from Cairo(has been scheduled for a long time)and completed in the next 2 days Setel Aviv and Ramala.
In Cairo, Blinken, in addition to Palestinian, unleashed a wider agenda on the issues of the area. As announced, he discussed the "political transition" efforts to Sudan (ie US controlled), as well as the launch of consultations on elections in neighboring Akrithocora, Libya. He also referred to developments in the war of Ukraine, looking for a "common place" to strengthen the "strategic co -operation" of the US -Egypt and in general "its support against Sedithic challenges".
In today's context, with imperialist competitions exacerbating the war in Ukraine, which affects all the "open" fronts and in the area of the wider Middle East, it is natural that the US is particularly reflected in particular for the evolution of the balance there. Mutual suspicion with Turkey exists and is inhabited, forming a cloudy landscape towards the evolution of bilateral relations. Even the "investment" of Juinsington in the Syrian Kurds is in danger of being blown up in the air of Erdogan-Assad, promoted by Putin.
The situation in Israel, in terms of the country's political scene, is not considered negligible to the US. Blinken visited Talaviv and Ramala in the shadow of yet another bloody confrontation that captures Netanyahu's government. Whose relations with the Bidenex government are followed mainly in terms of the Turan nuclear program. And he would probably prefer to have Trump's interlocutor and not Biden. The fact that the revival of the 2015 agreement has been possible to give ground for dialogue.A few hours before Blinken arrives, an Israeli invasion, a more lighter raid for years, in Jenin, on the occupied West Bank, shook the lives of 9 Palestinians followed by a deadly response from the Palestinian East Jerusalem, while the Israeli Army. Since the beginning of the year, Israeli -Palestinian Synthesis has claimed life in 35 Palestinians(mainly civilians and children)and 6 Israeli citizens(of whom a minor). Ανάμεσα σταπρόσφατα ισραηλινά μέτρα (targeting special Arabs and Palestinians who have Israeli nationality), what is estimated to reinforce bloodshed is the easier and faster acquisition of licenses for the rest of the Israelis.
Under these circumstances, the margins of the US Foreign Minister was limited and no significant developments were expected, with analyzes focusing on Washington's ability to influence the course of events. Other times, a US Foreign Ministry tour of the Middle East Signal Signal as Expectations to resolve the Palestinian as the confirmation of the Concomitant Regional Stabilization under their control. While now ... "The best they could ensure is to stabilize the status of Israel in order to avoid a repetition of May 2021_," said Miller, Miller,(American former negotiator), judging that… “This visit does not signal no change in the US position in terms of Israeli -Palatine conflict(…)Beyond expressing their birth support for the solution of the two states - again!So what does it signal?
Blinken's visit to Israel reflects Washington's will of Washington Jaggish reconnect with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who returned to a stronger, certainly taking advantage of the US involvement. The main causes of concerns in the policies of policies, except for Palestinian, are that there is a risk of napkin and other open fronts in the wider area. This is how Biden's freeze is interpreted in the revival of the 2015 agreement for the Iranian nuclear program.The agreement with Lebanon, in 2022, in the demarcation of marine zones, was characterized by Biden, who promoted her "historical achievement", is now being trained. But also the "Abraham Agreements", that is, the process of releasing relations between Israel and Arab countries, are on a row, with Netanyahu cultivating hope that Saudi Arabia will once be integrated. dissatisfaction and mutual suspicion.
Lately we have had a "wave" of US officials visits to the pride. Prior to the arrival of Blinken, CCIA Burns, , arriving in Israel, **, which, in addition to the Israeli leadership, also visited Tramala, where he met senior Palestinian officials. Neither in the case nor the other was made. It was preceded by the visit of the White House National Security, Jake Sally. So many high -level visits in such a short time rarely occur. It is speculated that these were for possible preparation of a Netanyahu visit to L.oko within the month.
All of these are movements that betray the deeper concerns of the IPAs about the future of power balances in the region, which are shown to be on their own if they continue to demonstrate the strategy that has characterized their policy in the Middle East in recent years. The US is no longer "playing" alone in the region and is an obvious location of their influence in Syria and Iraq, especially since the fall of 2015, which Russia, alongside Assad, has established its presence and is accepted as a factor in the region even From ... Tel Aviv. It is obvious that the Russian presence in Syria places Israel in weakness strongly supports US choices in Ukraine!On the other hand, Iran -Russia adopt is intensifying Israel's reactions and, possibly, the recent attack is related to this issue. Finally, China, which makes its presence more noticeable all over the globe, seems ready to set up in the area of the Middle East.
Based on today's data, the US is urgent for a relief in the West. The question is what percentage of mediating gravity have been deprived of decades. The current administration of L. Vice will undoubtedly seek to seek the restriction of losses in recent years.

 The 7.8 Richter earthquake on February 6th dipped millions of people in Turkey, Syria and in areas of Kurdistan to death and misery. It was followed by 7.5 Richter at noon on the same day to take up the disaster. Diyarbakir, Alexandreta, Pazardzik, Elbistan, Adakia, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Urfa, Imalatia, Kilis, Antipiaman, Adana, as well as other cities and villages and villages of Turkey, were shaken.
The results as the days go by prove to be more and more devastating. Lives looking for their children, friend, neighbor, their people, their people. Many are afraid that the dead are very much at their 1999 earthquake in Izmit.
As the hours and days go by and hope for life under the ruins, it gives way to despair, in unbearable pain, it becomes church, cry, anger. Rescue crews have not reached all the affected fields, many have not reached any machine. With their hands fighting Turks and Syrians getting trapped. Unfortunately, the walls that fell as if they were a matchbox, while the shortages of water, food, tents, blankets, medicines worsen the situation. After the first, the question of where the state is in is heard from more and more in Turkey. Rage takes the place of lament. Ankara trade unionists are still waiting for them to take them to rescue, but - as they say - they have no answer. And humanitarian materials from left -wing unions and Kurdish organizations are discovered. Journalists are arrested for the government's criticism of more, affected people are threatened with arrests if they talk to the media about taps they are facing.In Kojaeli's earthquake in the area of Izmit(Nicomedia)With the 18,000ths, it turned out that in the tragedy the circuit of construction industry in Turkey had played an important role in the tragedy. Regulations violations, licenses without controls, close ties with the government, corruption. In the echo of this tragedy, new regulations were issued to protect buildings by earthquakes. But these measures were once again undermined by the government policy. Buildings that were not complying with the regulations were parties with a fine, in accordance with the Erdogan Government's 2018 Amnesty Law 2018. 13 million buildings were legalized with this system. Such cheaper buildings became the tombs of the poor. The Government of Actogan has passed laws that allow violations of the regulations. In these constructions there were people who are now under the ruins and on the road. The so -called residential development was based on the construction of construction and the predatory exploitation of nature. Those who complained and resisted them, were arrested, persecuted and struck.
The promising element is the outbreak of international solidarity by trade unions, popular lands and bodies from many countries around the world. Among them in Greece, at a time very critical for the contradictions of the two bourgeoisie and the relations of the two peoples. The Turkish people and with them the peoples of Sisiria and in Kurdistan are in front of a new major test. Solidarity is very important. Both to save lives, and to build strong solidarity bridges in the common struggle against war, nationalism and imperialism.

 And if half of our heart is here, the other half with the peoples of Turkey and Syria is!The peoples who mourn the dozens of their dead and look for sounds in the ruins that they find their children, relatives, friends and neighbors. The hundreds of thousands of people who, without blankets, food and care, are out of the frost, and their calamity becomes a tool in the hands of the world's largest bosses, who in the name of "humanity" unfold their horrifying cynicism. To load the earthquake destroying -caused by insatiable hunting of profit -on the backs of poverty. To promote their arrangements, that is, the war arrangement of the countries of the region.
How much "ours" is this calamity!How similar in causes and results, in lies, cynicism and farms, like those we lived in earthquakes, snow, floods and fires over and over again. But how much likes with all the similar calamities that the peoples live in the four actions on the planet!And not only the peoples of the region and the so-called "Third World" but also the peoples of the Metropolitan and leadership forces of a Tuki-Imperialist system.
If we consider all this, it is obvious for us what it signifies and she is. The decline and rotting of capitalism. Its barbarism is shown under the burden of its impasses, which are exacerbated by the clinical and bloody peoples for peoples imperialist competitions. The urgent need for the struggle of the peoples to stand against this barrenness. To defend the life that is depreciated, the nature that is destroyed. To defend the present and pave the way for the future. The future of workers and peoples. Without exploitation, war, poverty and poverty.
War Preparation Visit In this context and in this warm juncture, the visit of the Foreign Minister to Greece and Turkey is a visit to the preparation of war plans !Tayth-Russian warrior. It is a visit to which the "good kid" of the US, Greece, will first give the "good example" even greater offering to the American imperialism!Already the latest developments(New US Systems in Thessaly, Military Personnel Shipment to Ukraine)They are predicting an even greater involvement of our country and our people Stoskinos of the devastation set up in the heart of Europe. However, there are still many that can be "offered" to the murderers of the peoples. Arranges to be Mediterranean, interventions in(west)Balkans, contributing to the approach to the Black Sea of Submarines planned to be sent to Ukraine from the US-West!How "symbolic" and how detecting real -life was the downside of the American aircraft carrier in Piraeus?
That any of them or others are formed on Blinken's visit to Athens will be the tools of the US Foreign Minister on his visit to Ankara. Where he seeks to tow NATO's "bad kid" in more effective for American interests.
With this war baguette, the US was leading and leading the parallel political-elective developments in the two countries. This is a "friendship" for war !A "friendship" ordered to serve a broader war mass!A "friendship" that not only does not solve but more striking the reactionary competition of the two bourgeoisie as it holds up(and up to bilaterally promising)All of the issues of megalogyisms and maximalisms that characterize them!Each one hopes that in the scene of a devastating "something will take" from what is roles in the region and the so -called "sovereign rights" in the Aegean and A. Mediterranean ... The "homeland" of the big class ... 
In this "homeland" that serves the murderers of the peoples and is ready for reactionary adventurism against the peoples of the region, ND, SYRIZA and PASOK are sworn in!For this "homeland" they are filled with war bases the whole country and decide again and re -arrears of billions of euros at the same time that our people sink into poverty and freezing!At the same time that in Ierapetra, in Rethymnon and Seole the country the people are left without hospitals who are dissolved for the sake of "fiscal stability". At the same time as medieval labor relations and an entire framework for the overthrow and suppression of the active -launch struggles to become a "normal country". At the same time as the "recovery fund" tune(that brought "growth"!)It is already in a hurry to issue a new ten -year bond in March!
For the government's management of this "homeland" it becomes the doggie of elections, a fight that has no trace of questioning about the big imperialist bosses of this "homeland", a fight that treats Tolaos as a beggar who can be "fooled".
A dual -page of Sunday's 5/2 step entitled "The Wealth and Evia of the Great Greek Clubs" _ It was revealing we would say about tantopal bosses of this "homeland". In the two -page parade all heavyweights of the big order and provided the(given)Confession of their profits in the conditions of the war and more likely crisis. At the same time, it is recorded - albeit in terms of urban realm - that this ejecting is due to their parasitic - metaphorical characteristics(e.g. energy)and in the loot of public wealth(e.g. Greek and recently the acquisition of LARCO). Μια εκτίναξη κερδών δηλαδήπου σε τίποτε δεν έχει να κάνει με την παραγωγική συγκρότηση της χώρας αλλάαντίθετα με την παραπέρα απόσυγκρότηση της όποιας παραγωγικής της βάσης ακόμακαι στον πρωτογενή τομέα!Μάλιστα είναι χαρακτηριστικό ότι στο ίδιο φύλλο τουΒήματος σε άλλες σελίδες καταγράφεται ο «κίνδυνος αφανισμού της ελληνικήςκτηνοτροφίας».
... and the homeland of the people! 
This "homeland", which is a war basis of the US-NATO-EU imperialists and is an enemy with the Turkish people and the peoples of the region is not a hepatic of the people. The people are struggling and claiming their own homeland! This will be more than the imperialist bonds military, financial and political. The one that respects the homelands of neighboring peoples and is bent by their side in the struggle against war and imperialism. The one that will form and conquer bonds of friendship, solidarity and peace all the peoples of the region. And, of course, in this homeland, labor and the people will not have local bosses in their neck. They will not be slaves, they will not live in a society without rights and freedoms. They will fight and build their own society, the socialist!
This is the only true and realistic resolution of the contrast of the Labor Order and the people on the one hand, the bourgeoisie and its imperialist patrons on the other. A contrast that has no "bridges", a contrast that is becoming increasingly chaos and explosive in today's warehouses. A contradiction whose resolution by conquering independence and the struggle for building socialism can only be done by the re -revolution.
However, this contrast is unmistakable and chaotic "every day and moment" of the people that the people need to defend and claim their tadms and life. This is the political, ideologically and organizational basis and the consciousness that every small and greater struggle needs to form and conquer. To be able to win and success. To make up the revolutionary perspective that this struggle can have. All this is not at all obvious in the cloud of the edition of the days and the ... months we are going through. All of this is obscured or overturned by the electoral and parliamentary cretinism on the left which is also a symptom and manifestation of the compliance and submission line.

 Red flag has previously reported how at the beginning of November last year, the trade union of high -income retailers, the trade union, was not ready to negotiate workers 'wage increases in 2023. At that time, the trade union claimed that workers' wage increases would be a danger to Finland's competitiveness. From now on are the trade union of services(PAM)And the trade union had gone to negotiating a collective agreement without success.
Originally PAM announced that it would start working in the form of a strike in the form of a strike on 30 January. At that time, the national mediator, who was a representative of the old state, asked for a strike in the Ministry of Employment and the Economy for a week. Of course, this strike transfer was transformed, and once again it was possible to see how the ministry, led by Mika Lintilä, a social democratic party -leading government, intervened in the work of the bourgeois.
Strike However, then started on 9th of time and it was a last day. The strike touched 160 grocery stores and 16,000 workers participated. The sulfurity appeared, but some younger strikers swirled their decisions after discussing the lacquer. It should be noted that the bourgeoisie repeatedly sought to threaten and pressurize the strikers and well -known trade union activists, but the actions were of no widespread importance, but the striker's front was strong.
PAM is currently demanding a $ 200 increase in wages and the union's leaders have declared the industrial action will intensify next week if the merchants agree to the increases. We will be with interest whether the union leaders will once again be cheated on their line members or whether that small but significant salary increase can be driven through.
All support for strikers!

 We have been wondering for more than a week because we have not received a reply from NAP(but also by the CMA), who participated in the meetings we called in Athens ahead of the one -year completion of the start of the War of the War and the US Foreign Ministry's visit to the country, declaring his principle with the content of our proposal.
Eventually the NAP comrades make sure that the question is resolved!This is happening ... ANTARSYA, which followed by its - exclusive pre -election - conference - conferences to a "open call" yesterday to a number of extra -parliamentary organizations for electoral cooperation. With this, we can only consider that the persistent willingness to proceed with the joint action for the complexity of anti-war-anti-imperialist response to the Tublinken visit and the evolving reactionary warfare and the reactionary warfare. Axises of a special place, which can with nothing to shake off the hui of the cakes, whatever colds as it suffered. Even if, as we are used to, the vertices and big words about the "anti -war movement" and "joint action" are over again!
In practice, however, turtle speed for the movement, on the one hand, and peroxy -reflections for the ballot box, on the other. With any relevant "deceleration" in the election campaign to deal exclusively with the bourgeoisie inside this space - which is obviously passing through the text of the call - and not at all with the fronts that insist on emerging life and class struggle.
But what to do, comrades who have the whims of "unleashing" us and shaking the calm waters of our designs. We hope in the case you will realize it before it is late and confront our appeal, by putting your strengths to build on February 21st, the spokesman for the masters as it is worth acknowledged the continuity of the continuity.
