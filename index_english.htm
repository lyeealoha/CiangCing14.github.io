<h3>Political Declaration and Principles of the International Communist Alliance</h3>
<h5>I. Introduction</h5>
<p>Communism is an unstoppable historical goal. Human beings walk towards it. No matter what changes we face today, this immortal goal will be achieved. </p>
<p>The main task of the Communist Party is to seize the regime to carry out the revolution and make ourselves and develop into a Marx Lenin Maoist Party -we must develop according to the characteristics of their respective countries -this is part of the world's proletarian revolution that arrives in the communist. Serve it. The existence of the Communist Party was the key to the proletarian revolution in the new era. We found that we were in the new era -the new era began with the great socialist October Revolution in 1917. Without a Marx Lenin Maoist Communist Party, it cannot be revolutionary, let alone the development of revolution to seize the regime and defend the new regime. </p>
<p>The International Communist Movement is the vanguard of the international proletariat. The main problem of international co -mobility is still the dispersion of strength, and the main danger is correctionism. Its unity is based on the foundation and guidance of Marxism -today's Marx Lenon Maoism -and the specific practice of applying it to the revolution and the world revolution. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao told us that "the history of the International Communist Movement also shows that the unity of the proletariat consolidated and developed in the struggle of the same opportunity, amendmentism, and divisionism." The current dispersion originated from the Soviet Union and the people of the people in China. Capitalism restoration, in the performance of different party and organization's new amendments, Peru -Activities and surrender -Right Opportunity Line (ROL 
 The emergence of R &amp; C), the amendment of the "Placonistism" of Nepalism, and the "Avakian" cancellationism in the revolutionary internationalist movement (RIM) has exacerbated this. Disclosure of divisionism and dispersion is the result of the basic principles of new revisionism in the proletarian movement. </p>
<p>The current boundary between Marxism and amendmentism is: (1) whether Maoism is the third, new and higher phase of Marxism and the necessity of revisionist and all opportunities; Whether the revolution is carried out in their respective countries, whether to recognize the revolutionary violence; (3) whether to recognize the destroying the old state organs and the use of the proletarian dictatorship to replace the bourgeois dictatorship; (4) whether to recognize the necessity of the proletarian revolutionary party; (5) whether Acknowledge the necessity of proletarian internationalism. </p>
<p>If you do not resolutely fight against revisionism and all opportunistic struggles, it is impossible to fight against imperialism and all reactionaries, and international joint movements cannot be taken one step again. This is why we are based on "the struggle of the two routes is the driving force of the party's development", which is the key to formulating and defending the proletarian red line and fighting against other non -proletariat routes. In other words, maintaining the party's red. </p>
<p>The revolutionary counterattack of Marx Lenin Maoism is using the people's war, the national liberation struggle, and the struggle of the proletarian and the world to defeat the people's development of the people to defeat the overall anti -revolutionary attack that was released in the early 1990s -it was mainly released by the US imperialism. We pay tribute to the heroic people's war in India, Peru, Turkey and the Philippines and the national liberation armed forces. </p>
<p>The era of imperialism and the world's proletarian revolution -we discovered that we were in this era, the era of crisis and eliminating imperialism -the class struggle in accordance with the people's logic determined by Chairman Mao Zedong [1], according to this, the proletariat did not fail the final failure. Essence Therefore, the restoration of capitalist restoration of the Soviet Union (1956) and China (1976) did not prevent the international proletariat from the revolutionary journey to eventually seize the regime on its road. These failures are just some moments of the development of revolution and counter -revolutionary contradictions, and we learn lessons to prevent future restoration. Decades of proletarian dictatorship -starting socialist construction in more than one -third of the world -produced the greatest social transformation and mass achievements in human history, unprecedented. </p>
<p>In the 1990s, the end of the Soviet Union of the Socialist Empire was neither the failure of Marxism nor the failure of socialism, but the decaying correctionism and the bankruptcy of the social imperialism. Marxism -Marx Lenon Maoism today -is the most thorough, progressive and rational doctrine in the entire human history; it represents new things, it is the last and most advanced classes in history: the world view and ideology of the proletariat; Class aware that its historical mission is the tomb digker of capitalism, so it is also the tomb digger of all class society. Maoism opposes all degeneration, outdated bourgeois ideology and its amendments. </p>
<p>For more than 170 years since the "Communist Declaration" was published in 1848, the ideology of the proletariat appeared and developed into three stages in the furnace of class struggle: (1) Marxism, (2) Marx Leninism, and (3) Marx Lenin Maoism. Maoism is the ideological ideology of the international proletarian universal science. It is a panacea because it is the truth; it is the third, new and higher stage of Marxism; Contemporary Marxism. </p>
<p>New revisionism such as Peru's right leaving opportunity routes, so -called "Plashachadaism" and "Avakianism", as part of the anti -revolutionary attack, act in the international proletarian movement, is an anti -Maoist countercurrent, trying to suppress The world's proletarian revolution. New revisionism denies Marxism, party, socialism, and proletarian dictatorship. However, the center of attack is concentrated in negating the people's war that is the basic and indiscriminate issue of Maoism. </p>
<p>Maoism is the fundamental regime. In other words, the regime of the proletariat, the regime of the proletarian dictatorship, and the regime based on the armed forces led by the Communist Party. In particular, it should be noted: (1) the regime of the proletarian leadership in the democratic revolution; (2) the socialist revolution and the continuous cultural revolution of the proletariat; (3) based on the armed forces led by the Communist Party, use the people's war And the regime of defense. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao established the strategy and strategy of the World Revolution. The development of the World Revolution is the main in preventing the wars of the world's imperialism -if it starts -our Communists must use the World Revolutionary War to oppose it. This requires us to lead the people's war to facing the war of imperialist aggression in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even Europe. Even without imperialist aggression, we must lead the people's war to revolution and spread to all countries and continents until pushing to the World Revolution, we will use it to remove imperialism and reactionaries from the surface of the earth. Therefore, it corresponds to the world revolution we want to use the revolutionary war, and its foundation is composed of the oppressed nation. </p>
<p>Therefore, the fundamental aspect of Maoism is the regime. The people's war and class regime are the basic and indiscriminate parts of Maoism -the political and military concepts of the proletariat: the Communist Party's leadership of armed forces seized and defended. </p>
<p>The revolutionary war and the people's war are the advanced forms of struggle -the basic problems of the revolution are solved; it is a military strategy corresponding to the political strategy (seizing power), allowing society to change in the direction of class and people; The main form of the struggle is that the people's army is the main form of the organization, a fighting, mobilization [2] and a new type of army produced. The People's War is a war that the Communist Party led by the proletariat to seize and defend the new regime. </p>
<p>In order to carry out the people's war, we must keep in mind the four fundamental issues: (1) the ideological form of the proletariat -Marx Lenon Maoism -in the specific practice and characteristics of the revolution of various countries, whether it is oppressed or imperialist countries; 2) The necessity of the Communist Party to lead the people's war; (3) a detailed explanation of its political strategy; (4) Base. New regime or front- 
 State -formation in base areas -the core of the People's War. </p>
<p>In order to establish a base, Chairman Mao determined three fundamental requirements: (1) with armed forces, (2) defeating the enemy, (3) mobilizing the masses. In other words, the development of guerrilla war eliminating the life of the enemy. Therefore, it creates power vacuum for the establishment, construction and defending the new regime -thus destroying old social production relations and establishing new social production relations. The contradiction between the new regime/new country and the old country has developed, and it must be rebuilt and anti -reconstruction according to the liquidity of the war. </p>
<p>Imperialism is a higher and final stage of capitalism. It is monopoly, parasitic, decaying and painful. It is in the last total crisis. Because of this situation, it is exhausted by its inevitable worsening and deepening periodic crisis. That's why it always has to start from lower. Its existence is only cleaned by the World Revolution. </p>
<p>Imperialism has always tended to reaction and war. Imperialism and the world reactionaries will collapse in the intersection of various wars. They will be cleaned by the revolution from the surface of the earth, and socialism will appear. Lenin clarified that "imperialism is a mud giant", Chairman Mao said that in strategic, we must completely despise imperialism. In terms of strategy, we must take it seriously. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao established his great argument: "From now on, within 50 years and outside to 100 years, it is a great era of completely changing social systems in the world. It is an era of overwhelming and earth. . In such an era, we must prepare a great struggle with many different characteristics in the form of struggle in the past. " </p>
<p>The process of the world's proletarian revolution -we developed in this era -the process of being cleaned from the surface of the earth and the world reactionaries. Therefore, the revolution has become the main tendency of the history and politics of the contemporary world. </p>
<p>All the basic contradictions in this era have intensified, and the main contradiction is the contradiction between the oppressed nations and imperialism. The objective conditions of the revolution have never been so mature. Subjective conditions are developing forward, crushing the total counterattack of decline, and shattering the pessimism and surrender of revisionist promotion and spread. Conditions every day is conducive to revolution. </p>
<p>The development of the world's proletarian revolution requires more people's war. This needs to be established or rebuilt the Communist Party in various countries, which should be applied to Lenin's teachings, "deep into the deepest people", "educate them in the practice of revolutionary violence" and "unremitting fighting, eliminating opportunism And the huge garbage dump of revisionism. " </p>
<p>The current international conference and new organizations born in this operation are the achievements of the international proletariat. It is a crackdown on imperialism, world reactionist, amendments and all opportunistic counter -revolutionary attacks. </p>
<p>The new international organization is a center of ideology, politics and organization. Based on democratic centralized systems and obedience to each party and organizations, they will continue to discuss the problems arising from each other. It will expand this program to -although it has participated in the same ones the same ones Principles and purposes -all the party and organizations that are still outside it. The task of new international organizations is to carry out the struggle to promote Maoism. As the sole command and guide for the world's proletarian revolution, in order to establish or rebuild the Marx Lenin Maoist Communist Party (delayed strategic task) services, Start, develop and coordinate people's war services in the world. </p>
<h5>2. The foundation for formulating the general political route of international common mobility</h5>
<p>By applying Marx Lennine Maoism to the specific practice and world revolution of various countries, we point out the following principles to establish and develop the general political line of the international communist movement: </p>
<p><strong> 1. New era </strong> </p>
<p>With the emergence of imperialism, the world is divided into a few compression nations and a large number of oppressed nations, and the conditions of the world revolution have matured. </p>
<p>In 1917, the victory of the great socialist October Revolution led by the great Lenin and the Bolshevik Party was an extraordinary milestone in the history of the world. It is the end of the world bourgeois revolution and the beginning of the new era. The proletariat assumes the era of damaging imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and semi -seal -sealingism: the era of imperialism and the world's proletarian revolution. There were many revolutions before the great October Revolution, and each of them provided new driving force for society. However, these revolution only replaced another exploitation system with one exploitation system. </p>
<p>The great October socialist revolution is the first revolution. It is conceived and established a society without exploitation and oppression. 
 ——The classless society. The great October's socialist revolution represents a complete turning point in human history. It has opened a new era of glorious long roads to socialism and communism. </p>
<p>The great October's socialist revolution has given revolutionary violence as an indispensable force in the entire world. Lenin said: "In the October Revolution, ... the revolutionary violence achieved a glorious victory." We believe that the revolutionary violence is a general law of Marxism, reiterating what Chairman Mao has determined: Revolutionary War Masterpiece ".
We, in order to achieve our ultimate goal communism, we must carry out three revolutions: (1) the democratic revolution -a new type of bourgeois revolution led by the proletariat of the backward country -establishing proletariat, farmers and The petty bourgeoisie -under specific circumstances -the joint dictatorship of the middle bourgeoisie -all these classes under the hegemony of the proletariat represented by the Communist Party; ; (3) Cultural Revolution -The cultural revolution is for the continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the emergence of uniforms and elimination of any capitalism, and the struggle against the restoration of capitalism -they have enhanced the dictatorship of the proletariat and moved towards communism. Serve. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao taught us, "metabolism is a common law that cannot be resisted in the universe." This is a historical law. In the struggle for the establishment of a new social system, it is impossible for the class to try only once. exception. The recovery of capitalist restoration of the Soviet Union (1956) and China (1976) is part of the historical struggle of socialism and capitalism -metabolism. </p>
<p>Lenin warned that the exploitation class would not stop after being defeated and confiscated. Due to failure, they have a hundred times more hatred and efforts to restore capitalism. Their resurrection wishes and intentions will become restoration attempts. This is why they must firmly succeed in the dictatorship of the proletariat, the purpose of ensuring the demise of class. Lenin announced: "The principle of eliminating capitalism and its residues and the introduction of communist order constitutes the content of the new era that has just entered the entire world ..." </p>
<p>As a result, Lenin pointed out that this task would take a long time -in order to completely eliminate the class -not only the need to eliminate the exploitation class, but also to eliminate the gap between urban and rural, gap between workers and peasants, and other gaps. </p>
<p>This contradiction will only be resolved through the long and complicated process of restoration and repeatedly, until the proletarian dictatorship and socialism are consolidated all over the world. Therefore, all the paths of the disappearance of the social class disappear — the country will also die -humans have entered the eternal glorious golden communism. Chairman Mao taught, "The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not take the will of people's own will. No matter how the reaction is attempted to stop the advancement of historical wheels, the revolution may always happen, and it will always happen, and it will always happen, and it will always happen. It will definitely win. " </p>
<p><strong> 2. The process of the World Revolution </strong> </p>
<p>There are two forces in the revolutionary movement around the world: the international communist movement and the national liberation movement, the former is the leader and the latter is the foundation. </p>
<p>The national liberation movement is the force in the nation that is oppressed by imperialism and reactionaries. In the 190s, Lenin gave the biggest attention to the struggle between India, China, and Persia. It proposed that the socialist revolution was not the only and all ways to oppose the bourgeoisie of the proletariat. All colonies oppressed the oppression. He said that these two forces are fused: the international proletariat movement of the entire world and the ethnic liberation campaign of the oppressed nation pointed out that the masses of the oppressed nations account for the majority of the global population. It has a decisive weight in the World Revolution. He concluded that the revolution shifted to the oppressed nation, but this did not deny the revolution of the imperialist country. In addition, he showed that a socialist country -like the Soviet Union -can develop in the blockade of imperialism. This is the law of unbalanced development in the world. </p>
<p>Lenin further developed Marx's theory, laid the strategic foundation for the world revolution that destroyed imperialism, and united the national liberation struggle with the international proletarian movement struggle. Although "the whole world is united!" It is the slogan of the Communists, but he proposed the slogan of guiding the struggle of these two forces, "The world's proletarian and the people of the world, unite!". The latter united the proletarian movement that builds socialism in an imperialist country with the national liberation struggle between colonies and semi -colonial countries. Communist International accepted this slogan. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao -developed the strategy and strategy of the world revolution -specifically this slogan according to the task at the time: "Marx Leninists all over the world unite, the people of the world revolutionary united, defeated imperialism, knocked down modern revisionism, and The reactionaries of various countries. "Therefore, he combined the national liberation movement and the international proletarian movement, and these two forces have promoted the development of world history. </p>
<p>The international proletariat movement is the theory and practice of the international proletariat. The proletarian struggle in three areas -thought, politics, and economy -the first appearance in history is the last class, and it is so struggle. The following milestones are noticeable: In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote the "Communist Declaration" and established the foundation and program of the proletariat; in 1871, the Paris Commune, the proletariat seized the regime for the first time; in 1905, the revolutionary general exercise; In 1917, the victory of the October Revolution in Russia, the proletariat established the dictatorship of the proletariat and started a new era. In 1949, the victory of the Chinese revolution, the joint dictatorship of the revolutionary class led by the proletariat, and continuously completed the socialist revolution. It changed the relationship between all parties in the world; in the 1960s, the proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong continued the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the dictatorship of the restoration and repeated confession. </p>
<p>We must develop demand struggle to serve the regime. The proletariat generated unions and strikes in the struggle of its demand for its demand. This is not only for the tools for the struggle for demand, but they also "exercise the class for the upcoming great struggle." Strikes are the main tools of demand struggle, and the overall strike is the supplement of the uprising. </p>
<p>The proletariat produced political machines: the Communist Party, which is completely different from other political parties and opposite. Its goal is to seize power, and Marx is so defined. Lenin clarified the characteristics of the new party during the hindrance to the old amendmentism. The old amendments produced the bourgeois worker party based on the workers and nobles, the bureaucratic bureaucracy, and the parliament fans. Such political parties adjusted the old order. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao Zedong developed the party building around the gun and proposed the construction of three major tools: the Communist Party, the new troops and the revolutionary united front, and the center was the Communist Party. </p>
<p>The proletariat produced the ideology of the world's proletarian revolution: Marx Lenon Maoism. </p>
<p>Marx explained and laid the foundation for dialectical materialism, using it to analyze capital -capitalist society -discovered the law of historical development. Marx and Engels gathered the essence of humans: German classical philosophy, British political economics, and socialism in France, laid the foundation for the ideological ideology of the proletariat. After Marx's death, Engels completed the work that Marx was still waiting to be completed, such as the second and third volumes of "Capital". He systematically and define Marxism an indispensable and harmonious theory of international proletariat. In Lenin's words: "Without reading all Engels' works, it is impossible to understand Marxism, nor can it be completely elaborated by Marxism." Without the struggle against wrong thoughts and positions, Marxism cannot take a step completely. Therefore, it must resist Pulu Donghe's right -government right deviation and the so -called creative development of Du Lin, and the opportunity positioning within the German Social Democratic Party. </p>
<p>Our immortal founder Marx and Engels showed scientific analysis that the collapse of capitalism and its inevitable transformation to communism -there are no longer exploiting people. They clarified the mission of proletarians all over the world: standing up in the revolutionary struggle of anti -bourgeoisie, united all workers and exploiters destroying it, and creating socialism and communism on its ashes. </p>
<p>Old amendments developed after Engels's death -Bernestein and Coski -Lenin fought with them and defeated them. In short, Marxism -in its first stage -established Marxist philosophy or debate materialism, Marxist political economics and scientific socialism. </p>
<p>Lenin developed Marxism and promoted it to the second stage, Marx Leninism. He was completed in the fierce struggle against the old revisionism. Old amendments deny Marxist philosophy, saying that a person should be based on neo -Kantism, which is idealism, not dialectical materialism. In terms of political economics, they deny increasing poverty and therefore advocated that capitalism meets the needs of the proletariat; they denied the surplus value and imperialism. In terms of scientific socialism, they advocate opposition to class struggles, against revolutionary violence and proletarian dictatorship -spreading peacetime and parliamentary fans. </p>
<p>Lenin teaches that the revolutionary politics of the proletariat is realized through its pioneer party. The Communist Party, the Communist Party without it -the proletariat cannot complete its main task to change the world. Thanks to the existence of the new Revolutionary Party created and led by Lenin, the Russian proletariat can use the revolutionary situation to respond to the imperialist war with the revolutionary civil war. Chairman Mao said: "The victory of this Revolutionary Party has changed the appearance of the world revolution." </p>
<p>Amendmentism is tampered with the principles of Marxism by citing new situations. Lenin said that amendmentism is a senior team in the bourgeoisie in the proletarian team. The struggle against imperialism must fight against revisionism -because they are two sides of the same coin. Lenin emphasized that amendmental attempts to divide chemicals and proletarian political movements, leading to the division of socialism. In addition, in this correct struggle against the uncompromising against revisionism, Lenin proposed that in the context of preparation and starting the First World War -the Empires War Wars as the Revolutionary War, thereby revealing that the old amendmentist was a society. Patriots and social sandwichists; he proposed that during the revolution, he must create new organizations, because reactionaries attack legal and open organizations, we must establish secret agencies, even for the work of the masses. He then achieved the October Revolution with the Communist Party and the armed uprising. </p>
<p>Comrade Stalin continued the work of Lenin -in the process of building socialism in the Soviet Union -he struggled with Trotsky, Jonovyv, Gaminov and Bukhalin. Stalin has developed this struggle for 13 years. It is wrong to solve the problem in an administrative way. </p>
<p>During the World War I, the Soviet Union had to defend the territory under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, and 25 million people defended the socialist motherland with their lives. Under the conditions of complex and difficulty -under the leadership of Comrade Stalin -the proletarian dictatorship is consolidated and socialism has won. The five -year plan implemented within 25 years planned the biggest change in production relations, which led to the most powerful development of productivity in history. The people have achieved the greatest social achievements so far. </p>
<p>We advocate Chairman Mao's position on Comrade Stalin, and he is a great Marxist. In addition, we must keep in mind that he excellent defines Leninism. We, Communists, have the role of defending his role in World War II, the Communist International, especially its seventh World Congress. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao Zedong also developed Marx Lenon Maoism to raise Marxism to the highest peak, and the theory of the proletariat turned into Marx Lenon Maoism. He completed this task in the tenacious struggle and shattered the right -leaving opportunity line within the Communist Party of China -we emphasized the struggle of shattering Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping's amendment. Husband's modern amendment struggle and defeated it. He realized the Chinese democratic revolution and uninterrupted to the socialist revolution and the proletarian cultural revolution. </p>
<p>From a historical point of view, the proletarian cultural revolution is the most outstanding development of Marxism -Leninism made by Chairman Mao; it is a solution to the continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat; "it represents a new new development of the socialist revolution. Phase, even deeper and wider stages. " </p>
<p>We emphasize two issues: (1) The proletarian cultural revolution means the milestone of the dictatorship of the proletariat. ——In 1976 Deng Xiaoping's counter-revolutionary coup-did not deny the proletarian cultural revolution, but just restoration- 
 Part of the repeated struggle is the opposite of negation, and it shows to us that the extraordinary historical importance of the proletarian cultural revolution has the ruthless forward of human beings to communism. </p>
<p>In this case, the most amazing political process and the largest mass mobilization ever on the planet have been generated. Chairman Mao determined its goal: "The current proletarian cultural revolution is based on the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalism from restoration of capitalism. It is necessary to build socialism and be very timely. " </p>
<p>Chairman Mao believes that without the correct ideological and political views, there is no soul. The proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution. The goal is to transform people's soul -in other words, transform the worldview and ideology -enhance the proletariat and the general public for the sake of The struggle of the regime, defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, the world revolution and communism. </p>
<p>Therefore, our Communists have three great swords: our founders Marx, great Lenin and Chairman Mao Zedong, our great task is to hold up, defend and apply Marx Lenin Maoism to place it in the guidance and guide of the World Revolution. superior. </p>
<p>The world's proletarian revolution roads and social change roads specifically began in the Paris Commune in 1871, and then the Russian Revolution in 1905. Later, during the First Empire World War, the great October socialist revolution victory in 1917 opened a new era of world history. </p>
<p>Shortly after this, imperialism showed a rotten crisis. In order to get rid of the crisis and re -determine the new world hegemony, the second imperialist world war began the confrontation between major powers. This war transformed into a great national liberation battle worldwide, and made the contradiction between revolution and counter -revolutionary contradictions more acute -leading to the disintegration of fascism and the great victory of the Soviet Union and the Red Army, as well as many other democratic revolutions in Europe and Asia. A widely socialist camp. </p>
<p>With the victory of the Chinese revolution, the new relationship between capitalism and the world's world power strategy has been formed. All periods after World War II were the period of fierce struggle between imperialism and socialism. The US imperialists realized the hegemony in the capitalist camp and threatened the world with nuclear bombs, which sounded in the class struggle throughout the world. </p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, the Right of the Soviet Union got up to block the development of socialism -with the death of Comrade Stalin -seize the opportunity, take offensive, modern amendments go to the sun, destroying the unity of the proletarian dictatorship and the international communist movement. At the 20th National Congress of the CPSU in 1956, Khrushchev's revisionism rampant, usurping the leadership of the party and the Red Army of Lenin and Stalin. The proletarian dictatorship was usurped for a national coup, causing capitalism to restore capital in the Soviet Union.
Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, the left of the Communist Party of China -launched an offense in defending Marx Leninism and Mao Zedong's thoughts. They started the Great Revolution of the proletariat, which deepened the socialist revolution. It integrates the path of class struggle and revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat -Marxism that has not been resolved in Marxism. It prevented capitalism from restoration in China for ten years. With the death of Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping Group -Deng Xiaoping Group, the right -wing, was encouraged to attack and usurp the power of the proletariat. </p>
<p>Subsequently, the World Revolution lost its base area and entered a new period of dispersion of international co -mobility. In the struggle against modern revisionism and defending Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong's thoughts, the party rebuilt in many countries in the world launched the people's war. Therefore, the torch of the world's proletarian revolution was maintained in armed struggle, such as India, the Philippines, Turkey, and the later Peru's people's war. Especially with the great leadership of the Peruvian People's War, under the great leadership of Gonzararo, through the application of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought into the Peruvian Revolution -Maoism is defined as a new and third, third, third and third of Marxism. One and higher stage. </p>
<p>In the general crisis of imperialism, a counter -revolutionary attack led by the United States was released. However, they had only intensified all the contradictions of this system, which caused the world to become increasingly chaotic and advanced its disintegration. This has produced a huge outbreak of the world's exploitation and oppressed people, continuing and promoting the ongoing people's war, preparing to launch more people's wars, and the plunder of the oppressed nation due to the internal contradictions of the imperialist internalism that is severely intensified. The exacerbation of the war. </p>
<p>Faced with the current situation, our Communists are united around Marx Lenon Maoism, facing a huge challenge to make a leap in the international joint movement, and formulate its general political route in order to fight against the anti -revolutionary overall attack with imperialism. It was stabbed into fragments in its sharp contradictions. </p>
<p>World history is entering a new historical period. Today, the Communists have accurately identified the time of the world's proletarian revolution. This is the key to understanding the current world power relationship, our situation and the situation of the enemy, and serving the development of the world revolution. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao taught us that the road is twists and turns, but the future is bright. The revolution will be successful sooner or later, and the communism will sooner or later shine on the earth, depending on the actions of the Communists. </p>
<p><strong> 3 . International situation </strong> </p>
<p>Adhering to Lenin's argument, the economic relationship of imperialism constitutes the basis of the current existing international situation. Throughout the 20th century, this new specific stage of capitalism -its higher and the last stage -thoroughly clear. The world is divided into unique features of imperialism. The basic contradiction of the entire process of capitalist society is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, when it transformed from non -monopoly capitalism to monopoly capitalism -or imperialism, the three basic contradictions developed in the world. </p>
<p>First pair of contradictions: the superpower and great powers of the oppressed nation and imperialism. This is the main contradiction at the moment, and it is also the main contradiction in the era of imperialism. The world is divided into two parts, part of which is a large number of oppressed nations -they are colonial or semi -colonial countries (the latter only has formal sovereignty or independence, and they are economically, politically, and culturally entered into imperialism); It is a small number of imperialists, superpowers or great powers -they are all oppressed nations. In terms of imperialist power, US imperialism is the only superpower of hegemony. Russia is still a nuclear superpower, and there is a small group of second -rate imperialist powers. </p>
<p>US imperialism is the largest capital exporter in the world, which is manifested in great economic imbalances. In order to maintain its hegemony, imperialism was forced to conduct multiple wars at the same time, as well as military existence on major continents. This leads to maintaining its huge military machines, espionage activities and coverage operations (Covered 
 Operations) The huge economic cost, the credit costs of the past war and the current war, the support of the veteran of the war; let alone the high social costs on their own land, contempt Conquering them and implementing racial extinction, which poured the class hatred of people all over the world. </p>
<p>As far as it is concerned, the oppressed country has the most and poorest population. They are suppressed by imperialism. They live under the conditions that cannot meet the development of human beings. They endure the deterioration of living conditions and the natural environment. They The torture of the systemic plunder war of imperialism and its local dogs. </p>
<p>Bulletinism is developed on the basis of semi -feudal and semi -colonies in these countries. It produces corresponding political and ideological types to prevent national development. It exploits the proletariat, farmers, petty bourgeoisies, and restricting the middle bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>Do not recognize the semi -feudal nature of the oppressed country, so as to deny the necessity of the use of farmers' war, ultimately deny the necessity of the democratic revolution of these countries, and negate the development of the people's war as a joint war -of which the countryside is the main, the city is necessary to supplement- - End the necessity of semi -feudalism, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. </p>
<p>The World Crisis will continue to be passed on to the oppressed country. As long as they are still the case, they will still be the reorganization of the imperialism. The imperialist policy was to use further reaction and violence to further national conquest or robbing and plunder war on the oppressed nation. The plans of imperialists are to divide countries and promote the redemption of the world according to military power relations and strategic occupation. What they sought was not peace, but to conquer the people with imposed "agreements" and "peace agreements" surrender treaties, but just legalized what they had obtained on the battlefield. </p>
<p>The oppressed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America -such as Chairman Mao pointed out -the basis of the revolutionary storm area and the world's proletarian revolution. It is necessary to emphasize that the oppressed country even expands to Europe. </p>
<p>We reiterate that the real national self -determination can only be achieved according to their respective situations through the new democratic revolution or socialist revolution. In this regard, we must establish or rebuild a new type of Communist Party to lead the Revolution to the end. Chairman Mao summarized all the struggles of the oppressed nation in the following great guidelines: "The country must be independent, the nation must be liberated, and the people must revolution!" </p>
<p>The second pair of contradictions: bourgeoisie and proletariat. </p>
<p>The economic crisis in 2008 began with the US financial crisis, and was passed on to the people of the oppressed nation and even the imperialist countries themselves. As a result, it crack down on the immortal classes of imperialist countries, and they fought fiercely to defend the achievements of the entire 20th century. The consequences of this crisis have not been overcome. This is why the recovery of employment is at the cost of decreased quality, reduced wages, and extension of working days. The recovery is at the cost of increasing excess exploitation to the proletariat. </p>
<p>proletariat- 
 The contradictions of the bourgeoisie also worsen due to the tide of immigration and compression of tens of thousands of war refugees and ordinary poor people -escape from the imperialist war and the brutal exploitation and oppression of the semi -colonial. Immigration is strengthening the proletariat of imperialist countries. These immigration waves are caused by this system itself. The "humanitarian tragedy" caused by them benefited the monopoly organization of imperialist countries, because these labor forces did not cost them, so they reduced their wages and reduced production costs. </p>
<p>At the same time, the imperialists themselves properly propagated the danger of the "terrorism" of these immigrants on their media, and preached the hysteria of Saudiism, breeding racism and nationalism. Imperialism uses the reactionary policy of sandwichism to divide the proletariat into local workers and immigrant workers to prevent the unified class conscious actions of the proletariat. Prevent it from being organized into a single class, with common interests and single ideology, single politics and single party -the Communist Party. </p>
<p>The contradictions of imperialist countries also exist in the revolution and counter -revolutionary room. This is not a problem of changing this or the political system -in other words, the government form of bourgeois dictatorship -but ending the socialist revolution to end the bourgeoisie of the bourgeoisie to the proletariat and the people with the socialist revolution. dictatorship. </p>
<p>Bourgeoisie- 
 The contradictions of the proletariat and all the contradictions in the imperialist nation are intensified. Moreover, due to the crimes of imperialist countries, especially the US imperialism, the crimes of the oppressed nations and their people, the imperialist country is increasingly resistant -this is a characteristic of its current decomposition stage. The imperialist war must go home. </p>
<p>In addition, in their own land, the American country's suppression power systematically continues to murder the poorest people. Essence In the face of oppression, the tendency is the rising of the masses in the rebellion, and the guns obtained by the extinction of them to the oppressed ethnic group are turned to their own oppression. Some performances that have confirmed this tendency have emerged. </p>
<p>In short, the main thing is that the war of the anti -imperialist war will grow, coupled with the increasing poverty of the anti -and oppression of class exploitation and oppression. This is happening in all imperialist countries. </p>
<p>When dealing with the basic contradictions of the world today-that is, the decisiveness marks the contradiction between international class struggles, revolution and counter-revolutionary struggles-we think the proletariat- 
 The contradiction of the bourgeoisie is not just the imperialist country. This pair of contradictions exist in all countries in the world. </p>
<p>In the oppressed country, it is manifested as the proletariat and bureaucrats- 
 The contradiction of the bourgeoisie. In these countries, the people have a center: the proletariat, which is the only class that can lead the democratic revolution to the end. Under certain circumstances, it develops its pioneer team -the Communist Party -to lead the people's war with action to form the workers and peasants alliance , Win the trusted ally -bourgeoisie -under specific circumstances and conditions -united ethnic bourgeoisie (medium bourgeoisie). </p>
<p>In these countries, the ruling class, the more tried to rebuild the country, the proletariat and the bureaucracy- 
 The conflict between the bourgeoisie of the business is even more obvious. The two confrontation classes began to divide the polarization, and the proletariat became more important as the sole leader of the democratic revolution. </p>
<p>We emphasize the three basic contradictions in the democratic revolution: the contradictions of national-imperialism, the contradictions of the people-bureaucratic capitalism and the masses- 
 The contradiction of the feudal system. Any of these three contradictions will become important contradictions according to the revolution. In the oppressed country, the contradiction of the proletariat-bourgeoisie manifests as the people- 
 The contradiction of bureaucratic capitalism (therefore, the proletariat is the leading class of the people). When the democratic revolution has won -the economy confiscation of imperialist capital and bureaucratic capitalism, the feudal property of the Land Land is allocated to poor farmers according to people, mainly because there is no place or less poor farmers -the socialist revolution has begun to be uninterrupted at this moment. Development, change the nature of the revolution, and then the proletariat- 
 The contradiction of the bourgeoisie has become the main contradiction. </p>
<p>As a Maoist, we are very clear that after the victory of the socialist revolution -has established a dictatorship of the proletariat 
 ——It corresponds to continuous cultural revolutions, in order to prevent capitalism from restoration and continue to advance to communism, either everyone enters communism or no one enters. </p>
<p>The third contradiction: internal contradictions of imperialism. As Lenin teaches us: imperialism is not one -has different imperialist countries. In other words, there are imperialists and superpowers, and they are divided into the world based on economic, political and military power relationships; the relationship between strength has been changing and developed by collusion and competition. </p>
<p>The United States is now occupying the only dominant superpower. After the disintegration of the Social Empire Soviet Union in 1991, the economic strength of imperialist Russia declined, as is the military power, but it still maintains the characteristics of a nuclear superpower. In turn, other imperialist powers, such as Germany, Britain, France, Japan, China, Austria, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Canada, Italy, Spain, etc., all belong to a few oppressive countries. Since the ten years of the 1990s, they have competed for the oppressed country of Xingua's absence of the Soviet Union of Social Empire. Since then, the former Soviet Republic of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the so -called Greater Middle East -Persia Gulf, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, North Africa-, Far East 
 —— North Korea -, Southeast Asia -Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia — and Latin America -Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela -all the events related to this -the fighting or not good -all includes all included -includes all include all inclusive -all include all include all inclusive — all include all include In the competition of Xingua to divide these countries. </p>
<p>Today's world situation is caused by the development of the war of aggression against the U.S. imperialist blood and fire. Their main strategic goal is to take the status of Russia's nuclear superpowers, contain social imperialist China, and promote its gradual open economy. Alliances with other imperialist powers -according to the degree of convenience -such as Germany, France, Britain, etc., it is used to subvert the order of impact on Russia's high strategic value, and implement economic sanctions as a threat to all imperialist powers to all imperialist powers. Essence Conversely, Russia strives to maintain its influence area, especially Ukraine, Syria and Iran. </p>
<p>As for the imperialists, whether they are alone or united, they oppose one or maybe many oppressive countries. Not only are the main contradictions showing at this moment, the third contradiction -the contradiction of the imperialists -also shows it. U.S. imperialism uses "division and rule" to deal with other imperialist powers. Imperialists violate their own treaties, their own international rules -the principle of non -aggression -because this rule is allowed to observe other imperialists. This is why peace and harmony between imperialists are repeatedly repeated old teeth stories -like the story of "Super Imperialism" and "Super Imperialism", spreading like "new imperialism", "new colonialism", "new" Reactionary concepts such as liberalism, globalization, and "geopolitics" are used by the imperialists and amendments to mainly oppose the struggle of democratic revolution and ethnic liberation. </p>
<p>Empireism is absolute, and collusion is relative. This determines the condition and temporary nature of the Imperial Union; this is why it cannot be said to be "imperialist group", which is amendmentism. Therefore, the European Union is not a group or "European Imperialism", but in Germany's hegemony -competition with France and collusion, attempting to increase its strength -a European national alliance, competing with US imperialism. </p>
<p>The second -rate imperialist power struggle to turn itself into a new superpower, and began to fight for the world hegemony occupied by US imperialism today and improved — a new century war -the new division world -has been divided into division -has been divided The world -and the new world order. </p>
<p>The contradiction between socialism and capitalism -corresponding to the entire era of the world's proletarian revolution -under the current situation, it shows and developed in the field of thought and historical Doctrine.
All of these have promoted the bourgeois state (the great landlord served the imperialist country in the oppressed country- 
 Bourgeois countries) greater reactionary, responding to the revolutionary situation of imbalanced development around the world. It is manifested as the absolute power of the administrative power -presidential absoluteism or fascism -according to the characteristics of different countries. Facing the crisis and revolution in the face of rule, and to concentrate power to prepare for the war of imperialist aggression. </p>
<p>The objective situation of the world is basically due to the deterioration of the total crisis of imperialism's decaying crisis -and even the reactionaries themselves have acknowledged it. This is the deepening of its collapse. A few imperialists and the third world's bourgeoisie and landlords have huge wealth of social production, but the people of the world have been deprived of their wealth. The result of all these is the deepening crisis and a shorter cycle in the final crisis of imperialism, prompting all imperialist countries to launch a new plunder war. </p>
<p>Imperialism is still alive, US imperialism -the only hegemonic superpower and the world's anti -revolutionary gendarmerie -the main enemy of the people of the world; it is still desired in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; Base, impose plunder war; it continues to oppress the people in the country. However, the same situation has become more difficult to suffer, and 90%of the people of the world will get up sooner or later to oppose imperialism and reactionaries. This is inevitable. All of this is in the fierce struggle and imbalanced development, which is a huge wave of the new world -proletariat revolution. </p>
<p>Since this decade, the crisis of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism is even more serious around the world. Whenever its decay deepen, all contradictions will intensify; this leads to a more imbalanced development in the world. This situation is manifested in the great activities of the masses, and its outbreak has shivered all reactionaries and its amendments. It has an unprecedented outbreak and ubiquitous. The objective situation and subjective factors quickly encountered — mainly the Communist Party, and the new type of Marx Lenin Maoist Party launched a new people's war. Therefore, a new moment began, and this revolution was part of the world's proletarian revolutionary new waves. This situation determines the tasks, strategies and strategies of the Communist Party of the world. </p>
<p><strong> 4 . International Communist Movement </strong> </p>
<p>We reiterate the comprehensive effectiveness of the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848, which is the starting point and cornerstone of the birth of the international communist movement. It establishes the basic principles and programs of the proletarian revolutionaries. Our great founders, Marx and Engels, gave great calls and slogans: "The world’ s proletarians, united!"This combat slogan inspired the fighting of the world's martyrs and guided the road of liberation. The revolutionary fire of Marx and Engels ignited the world and changed the historical process of the world forever. </p>
<p>Marx said: "Past experience proves: ignoring brothers unity between workers in various countries, and ignoring the unity of brothers who should encourage them to fight firmly in the liberation struggle, they will be punished. Strive to be in common. " </p>
<p>Lenin clarifies the real proletarian internationalist needs: "First, the interests of the proletarian struggle of a country's proletariat obey the interests of the proletarian struggle around the world; second, the nation that is required to defeat the bourgeoisie is capable Determined to undertake the greatest national sacrifice to overthrow international capital. "Chairman Mao proposed the deepest internationalism:" This is the spirit of communism. " </p>
<p>Therefore, the history of the international communist movement is a brilliant struggle. In this process, the Communists around the world fight for the struggle, unite, and the united goal: communist society. </p>
<p>Three internationals have been established in this heroic struggle: </p>
<p>The first international, or the International Workers' Association, was established in the fierce struggle between Marx and Engels in the fierce struggle against anarchic, Brownia, and other positions. The internationality of the proletariat and its revolutionary party are firm and scientifically combined, laying the ideological foundation of the proletarian revolution. At that time, the international attempt to usurpted its opportunityist penetration and surrounding, and Marx proposed that the International Workers' Association was best to end instead of witnessing that it was united by principled unity. </p>
<p>The second international, based on Marxism, was established in 1889 and serves the majority of socialist organizations and political parties, especially European and North American organizations and political parties. After Engels died, Bernstein and Coski's amendments attacked the leadership of the Second International. In the pretext, oppose the struggle of the anti -imperialist war. They voted in the parliament to support war loans and rejected the Empires War as a revolution -they supported the imperialist war and their bourgeoisie -have become patriotic people, social sandwiches, and social traitors. </p>
<p>The establishment of the third international in March 1919 was the result of the great leadership of Lenin and the long -term struggle of the international co -internal movement under the development of the Bolshevik party. It condenses the combat of the Tsar, imperialism, and all oppositions, and unspeakable opposition to the fought of all the opportunities and amendments of the Second International Party in the second international party. Lenin envisaged and established the Third International as a war machine to carry out the world's proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The establishment of the third international is a great leap in the history of the international communist movement. </p>
<p>Third International -CI or Comintern -Existing for 24 years, 7 World Congress was held during the period of dissolution in 1943. It has to develop in a complex environment. This complex environment is manifested as its founder and main leader -the great Lenin -died in 1924, the huge challenge of Soviet socialist construction, fascist rising in many countries in the world -especially Europe -and the second time -the second time The beginning of world wars. </p>
<p>Its existence was strongly influenced by the two years of struggle for 13 years in the Bolshevik party for 13 years. Among them, the left is under the leadership of Comrade Stalin - Baconism, Bukhalinism and Gaminov- 
 Jiunvi also has the right of right -tied opportunities and other factions and black lines to oppose their efforts to weaken the dictatorship of the Soviet Union's proletariat. Behavior. </p>
<p>Therefore, the Communist International has suffered a bias of right tilt and "left" -especially during the five to seven periods -it released many wrong suggestions and instructions, which caused some harm to the revolutionary party and process. However, the main thing is Comrade Stalin's leaders -the development of two routes -the leftist in the Communist International prevented the usurping power of revisionism and shattered the influence of Trotskyism and Jonovyvism in the leadership. Under the correct and fair leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Communist International maintained red, and Marxism -Leninism occupied the upper hand, and the amendments could not look up. </p>
<p>Due to the environment and challenges at the time, the seven major in 1935 were particularly outstanding. This important conference must answer new new questions in the difficult and complicated situation. </p>
<p>The Seven Congress of the CPC has established a strategy for the world's anti -fascist front and the people's front to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and the development of the proletarian revolution, and at the same time, with the fascist counter -revolutionary offensive operation. With it, for the first time in the history of the International Communist Party, the international proletariat and the people of the world can unite under the same banner, the same policy, the same plan, and the same leader. The task inherited from Lenin, the real war machine of a world revolution. </p>
<p>Under the guidance of the Communist International, millions of people rose like anti -fascism, revolution, and defending the Soviet Union as steel torrents. The Chinese revolution adheres to the end, changing the power relationship between the fight against imperialism and reactionaries worldwide, and is conducive to socialism, proletarian, and oppressed people. </p>
<p>Under the leadership of the Communist International, the Communists have conducted a heroic fight for guerrilla war -such as the Spanish Civil War -in dozens of countries -not only in Europe, but also in Asia. The revolution in these countries has no victory, resulting in this result because there is no mature and prepared Communist Party based on Marx Leninism and vigilant amendments. Nevertheless, as historical shows, its struggle has contributed to defeating fascism. The Communists have demonstrated to the world the high heroic and heroicism of the Communists, and the morale of class is not allowed to be hit. </p>
<p>Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the CCP used the decision of the Seven National Congress to understand how to use a united front policy for the specific needs of the Chinese revolution -to implement independent and united struggles, defeated the Japanese fascist, and continued to liberate the war until the national regime was seized, until the national regime was seized, Defeated the country's ruling class and its imperialists, completed the new democratic revolution, and continued to carry out the socialist revolution. The creative application of Marxism -Leninism and the application of the establishment of the Seven Congress to the Chinese Revolution have led to a deeper development and comprehensive understanding of the united front, and comprehensively developed the theory and practice of the people's war. </p>
<p>The problems and deviations in many countries are mainly due to the use of the united front of the united fronts in various countries. The main responsibility is to apply the international route to the Communist Party of their respective countries. According to Chairman Mao, in order to establish a correct assessment of this experience, a clear boundary line must be drawn between those who are still in Marxism and those who are sliding into the amendments. We need to distinguish between main errors and errors in practice. The most important thing is that Chairman Mao formulated the six basic tools of the united front, the three basic tools of the revolution, and its relationship. </p>
<p>In many countries such as Italy and France, after the heroic resistance of the anti -Nazi fascist armed struggle, due to the right -leaving opportunist position in the leadership of the Communist Party, these parties left the guidelines of the Communist International and Marx Leninism. Basic principles, their leadership surrendered in front of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, it was centered on defending the democratic and free regime, betrayed the revolution, and fallen into the most decaying amendmentism, modern amendmentism. </p>
<p>In the world, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the anti -fascist front was used well -the center is to defend the proletarian dictatorship represented by the Soviet Union. As a result, the fascist's proletariat dictatorship and the world revolution are advancing. The victory of the anti -fascist war is the great and heroic victory of socialism. It is the victory of the international proletarian and the world's oppression of the people to the imperialism and the world reactionaries. </p>
<p>With the victory of the anti -fascist war, the Imperialist camp was weakened, and the proletarian revolution grew. Thanks to the glory of the Red Army and the War of Resistance, the revolution has expanded to Eastern Europe and Central Europe, and reaching some German -socialist camps to grow. It is worth noting that with the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, the revolution and counter -revolutionary power relationship internationally became conducive to the world revolution. The development of the World Revolution has reached the stage of strategic support -a powerful socialist camp and a strong colonial and semi -colonial ethnic liberation campaign. </p>
<p>That's why we think that the Seven National Congress is an important Marxist Leninist conference. He armed the proletariat with a correct and reasonable political route to fight and promote the world's proletarian revolution. </p>
<p>) Or Communist International. </p>
<p>When reviewing the history of international joint mobility and the proletarian revolution, we see that Comrade Stalin understands how firm and wisely uses -in the complex and difficult situation -the real proletarian internationalism defined by Lenin, so that special interests and nations The interests of the interest as the overall international proletariat put the world ’s proletarian revolution and communist cause first. </p>
<p>In 1943, the Communist International announced the dissolution, and the international joint movement entered a relatively decentralized period. This was mainly caused by the divisionism and betrayal of modern revisionism. Modern revisionism is a countercurrent represented by Bai Laud, Tieto, Temoliti, Doriez, and Khrushchev (main). At the 20th National Congress of the CPSU, the Khrushchev Group usurped the leadership of the CPSU, the Red Army and socialist countries -the bourgeoisie of the army and the social fascism of the amendment party, the anti -people, State -destroys the basic principles of the proletariat's dictatorship and damage the unity of the international communist movement. </p>
<p>In 1947, the Communist Party and Workers' Party Intelligence Bureau was established. Comrade Stalin fought fiercely with modern revisionism through the Intelligence Bureau to crush and condemn Tito correctionism. It was the Intelligence Agency that began the struggle against the first country that opposed the amendments. At the Budapest meeting, Tito amendments were condemned and expelled, and it clearly stated that it was a lie that Comrade Stalin's revisionist route and other corremists' routes and other amendments after World War II was a lie. Intelligence Bureau -under the leadership of Comrade Stalin -began the struggle against modern revisionism, and Chairman Mao completed the struggle many years later. </p>
<p>The mission of the Communist Party on the world -after the death of World War II and Stalin -was carried out in the fierce struggle against modern revisionism. Among them, Chairman Mao appeared as the great leader of the Growth World Revolution. </p>
<p>In 1957 and 1960, Moscow held two international conferences of the Communist Party and Workers' Party. The declaration of these two meetings corresponds to the development of the two route struggles in the international communist in the international communist at that time. Their result is to concessions. Essence Considering that the weight of the CPSU is very large and its internal situation is very difficult, this reflects the correct practices of the leftist led by Chairman Mao as the leaders of the CCP leaders who use reasonable, favorable and prevailing.
On June 14, 1963, the "Suggestions on the General route of the International Communist Movement" was published in the well -known "China Reinstallation", and then published the "Nine Comments". Essence </p>
<p>Only with the distinctive boundaries caused by the great discussion -Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Communist Party of China, the International Communist Movement can be promoted to the great leadership of Chairman Mao and its contribution to the world's proletarian revolution. </p>
<p>While developing this struggle, Chairman Mao also carried out the right of right -leaning opportunism within the CCP -the struggle between the party and the state's important agencies. </p>
<p>Chairman Mao and the CCP believe that in this case -it is not enough to adapt to the new communist international, because the ideological and political foundation -at that time, it should be Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought -not sure. Especially the Albanian Labor -Evil Hozha led -did not accept Mao Zedong's thoughts, and wanted to be based on Marxism -Leninism, and did not consider existing new development, because Hocha, essentially opposed Mao Zedong's thoughts. </p>
<p>With the Great Revolution of the proletariat in China, Chairman Mao's influence is growing around the world. The CCP's energy is concentrated on very urgent things, such as Liu Shaoqi- 
 Deng Xiaoping's amendments to reconcile the regime of the People's Republic of China, and how to continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is how Chairman Mao is in the struggle at home and abroad that opposes the amendments -the great mentor of the proletariat and the great leader of the world revolution, his thoughts have become the third stage of Marxism -despite the definition and definition and It is admitted that its struggle only happened in the future. (We) It has been forty years to pursue this goal, and the International Maoist Unification Meeting is a very important step. </p>
<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, under the influence of the Great Revolution of the proletariat, the revolutionary process of anti -modern revisionist struggle gave birth to the establishment of the Communist Party and the People's Army that adheres to Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong. The Communist Party (Marxism -Leninum) and Maozong Center; the Philippine Communist Party in the Philippines; in Turkey, the Turkish Communist/Marxism -Leninism. In addition to the fight against correctionism in other countries, it also defends Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong ideas to defend the proletarian culture. The Great Revolution and the People's War. </p>
<p>In September 1976, Chairman Mao died, and Chinese amendmentists attacked Chairman Mao and their thoughts on counter -revolutionary coup. The joint of Marxists encountered serious and complex problems. With the death of Chairman Mao and the amendment of Deng Xiaoping and his accomplice in China, our Communists have become decentralized in the world, and there is no center or world revolution. The effectiveness of Mao Zedong's thoughts released the triple revisionist attacks of Deng Xiaoping (Chinese amendmentism), Hocha (Albanian Amendmentism), and Brezhnev (Russian Activities). </p>
<p>In 1976, China's counter -revolutionary coup began a new period of profound dissemination of international common mobility. Among them, the US imperialism launched the general anti -revolutionary attack. The concentration and main attack center were the soul of the revolution -its ideological form, Marx Lenonaoism. </p>
<p>In the autumn of 1980, 13 Communists and Organization signed a statement that the Marx Leninists, workers and oppresseders of the world, called on the Communists to unite around Marx Leninism and insist on Chairman Mao, but think that it is not a new one At the stage, it is not generally applicable -the work is mainly led by the American Revolutionary Communist Party. </p>
<p>The second meeting in 1984 was held, and it decided to set up the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM). In the establishment of a declaration, it reiterated that it was guided by Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong. </p>
<p>Revolution is a step forward to move forward again. This is why it is necessary to make a correct and fair evaluation of this experience. In this regard, it is necessary to analyze the process of the two route struggles in the inter -revolutionary transportation and the role of each party. For example, every revolutionary body, left, Zhongpai, and right are determined in the development of its core two routes. </p>
<p>In the ten years of the 1980s, under the great leadership of Chairman Gentararo, the Peruvian Communist Party was raising, defending and applied Maoism in the international communist movement as the third, new and higher stages of Marxism. The main contribution of Chairman Gondosaro to the international communist movement was the high, defending and applied Maoism in the Peruvian people's war launched on May 17, 1980, and defined Maoism with thorough and scientific methods. This incident has basic importance to the World Revolutionary Revolution and the International Communist Movement because it confirms the effectiveness of Maoism and the People's War. With his heroic sacrifice -in the dungeon of imperialism and reactionaries, he was murdered 29 years later -his name permanently engraved in the great proletarian gallery. </p>
<p>After the secrets of the secrets in inter -revolutionary transportation, it finally acknowledged that Maoism was a new stage of Marxism in 1993. </p>
<p>Existence for more than 20 years was more than 20 years -from 1984 to 2006 due to Bola Changda's betrayal of the Nepalese People's War and the United States Revolutionary Communist Party to obey the "new comprehensive" claim of Avakian's amendmentism. In 2012, the revolutionary transport was officially dissolved. Its existence reflects the two route struggles of the international communist movement. Inter -Revolutionary transportation serves the task of fighting again in the world's proletarian revolution and the Communists, and the left -in the struggle -in the struggle -can maintain the guidance and guidance of Maoism as the core of the world revolution. </p>
<p>However, in 1992, Chairman Gangsaro was arrested and subsequently hit by the Peruvian people's war -this hinders the actions of the leftist in the international Communist Party -the right -leaving opportunity route of the United States and Revolution and the amendments and surrender ( ROL) combines flow, uses complex situations to attack the left, and promote its inferior hegemony -first concealed and then publicly spreads correctionism, and opposes Marx Lenin Maoism, the so -called "new synthesis". </p>
<p>Revolutionary transportation is even more lack of cohesion. After the "Century of the Revolutionary Games Fight for the People's War" (2000) has been approved and adopted this position, the United States and Revolutionary Communist Party -headed by Avakian -began to deny it and slipped into the path of correctionist. Attack Maoism. This exacerbates this situation. In the next few years, Prachanda and Avakian -both are correctionist tendencies and heads -not only inside the revolution, but also competing for hegemony in the entire international joint movement. The lack of cohesion in ideology, politics, and organization has intensified. Finally, these amendments have disintegrated the revolution in their committees. Revolutionary operations caused negative effects and degeneration, and went to bankruptcy and dissolution. </p>
<p>Today -when a new world -pro -proletarian revolution is generated in the world, the people's war is conducted in India, Peru, Turkey, and the Philippines. It is prepared in many countries. When the world has a heroic struggle for national resistance and the people's resistance, When the total crisis of imperialism and its drowning have been greatly intensified -urgency and the two route struggles that must carry out the core of the international joint movement to a higher level, the purpose is to establish and develop its necessary, fair and correct general political routes. By using the people's war to ignite the revolutionary star fire in many countries, this new huge waves have been further promoted, and the anti -imperialist revolution movement under the leadership of the people's war and proletariat has been further promoted. </p>
<p>This is why it is necessary to deepen the ideological and political struggle on the basis of the historical experience of the proletarian revolution and the overall proletarian dictatorship. This evaluation, especially the application experience of the third stage of Marxism -Maoism -Maoism. </p>
<p>It is difficult, long and complicated to implement Marx Lenin Maoism as a guide and guidance for the world revolution. Without a hard struggle, Marxism will not develop, but in the end, Maoism is guiding the new huge waves of the world's proletarian revolution. , Socialist Revolution and proletarian cultural revolution -according to their respective situation -and the transition to the glorious and golden communism, it needs to promote it. </p>
<p>In particular, it is necessary to maintain a deepening of new amendments in different forms, because -although they are exposed and crushed in the international joint movement -they are still through right -leaning and "left" leaning opportunities. The influence of positions and other plans, they damaged the international operation as a overall unity, because they are the main danger of international common mobility. </p>
<p>Celebrating the establishment of the first international conference and the establishment of new international organizations has historic and extraordinary importance. They are the achievements of the international proletariat.

We have once again cooperated with and overcomes the huge steps of the dispersal of international common mobility. It has begun a new stage of organizational struggle to rebuild the Communist International under the command and guidance of Maoism. The development of the new people's war in war. </p>
<p><strong> 5 . The principle of the new proletarian organization </strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Contradiction -the only basic law of eternal substances constantly changing; </li>
<li>The masses create history and rebellion; </li>
<li>Class struggle, proletarian dictatorship and proletarian internationalism; </li>
<li>Apply the general truth of Marx Lennine Maoism into the specific situation, and integrate it with the practice of the revolution in each country; </li>
<li>Firmly apply the necessity of independent, autonomous, and self -reliant the necessity of the Communist Party of Marx Lenin Maoism; </li>
<li>Incomplete and ruthlessly fight against imperialism, revisionism and reactionary; </li>

<p>In the conclusive Marxist truth, we deliberately reiterated Chairman Mao's proposal: "From the perspective of Marxism on national theory, the army is the main component of the state power. Whoever wants to seize the state power and keep it, who should have it, there should Powerful army. Someone laughed that we were the "Master of War". We are the anemone of the Revolutionary War. This is not bad, good, and Marxism. Create a Democratic Republic. The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the labor masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords only with the power of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the entire world can only be useful for use The gun can be transformed. " </p>
<p><strong> 6 . The solemn decision </strong> </p>
<p>As the Communists, we are the single class in the world -the children of the international proletariat — it is connected with the indispensable destiny -communism -either everyone enters or no one enters. To this end, we resolutely obey the proletarian internationalism, which is a basic principle of international co -mobility. We have expanded the powerful and immortal slogan of Marx and Engels in the "Communist Declaration": "The world's proletarians, unite!" </p>

 Basathara-Ghumusus-Gavali Division of the CPI(Maoist)surfaced in the
Niyamagiri hills range of Kalyan Singhpur block in Odisha's Rayagada district
before the upcoming Republic Day.</p>
<p>The Maoist party claimed that the Republic Day is only meant for the rich
instead of poor. The Maoists had appealed to the people to boycott the day’s
celebrations.</p>
<p>In yet another poster, the Maoist party appealed to the Dongaria Kandha tribe
to drive away the Odisha PVTG Empowerment and Livelihood Improvement Programme(OPELIP), a Government agency for tribal development from the area alleging
that it is the manipulating the people’s movement.</p>
<p>"The OPELIP is involved in spreading false information and creating brokers.
So those people, who are involved in this nefarious activity, are warned to
leave this agency or else face the consequence. Due to this agency only one to
two persons per village are really benefited. In the name of reform, it has
made the people idle. So the Niyamagiri people should be alert."</p>
<p>In fact, the private companies are funding the agencies like OPELIP. The real
purpose of the agency is not to help, but to suppress peoples’ resistance.
Along with OPELIP agencies like Tata Trusts, New Hope, OTELP, Living Farms are
working in the guise of police informants. They are anti-movement, anti-
tribal, anti-people and anti-national, the Maoist poster alleged.</p>

 Ladeira/Folhapress </p>
<p>According to a CNN journalist, with information leaked behind the scenes, 
 The high command of the army discussed, during the November meetings, if 
 take the initiative for a "military intervention" first 
 of the settlement of Luiz Inácio. Always according to the monopoly of the press, a 
 majority, the reactionary generals concluded that it was not time to 
 complete the coup. The information also gives an account of the fact 
 that one of the men who mainly managed the Golder propaganda 
 It would be Walter Braga Netto, four -star general of the reserve e 
 Candidate to Vice President on the Bolsonaro blackboard, the weak. Obviously, 
 The general denied, but did not convince. </p>
<p>The US vehicle in Brazil also underlines that there was in the navy 
 greater support for institutional breakdown, then headed 
 from the admiral Garnier Santos - the same who, angry, did not participate 
 Not even to the ceremony in which he would pass the command. The journalist 
 Marcela Matos, of the Veja magazine, also reports that there are comments behind 
 the scenes of the new government on an articulation involving the Marines, which 
 they would have been mobilized to start a revolt as a spark of 
 Golder movement. The initiative was interrupted, as it would not be there 
 was unity in the high command of the Armed Forces(ACFA)It was for this reason 
 that General Braga Netto advised the camp who asked for a blow 
 of military state in Brasilia to wait and "don't lose faith"? </p>
<p>According to the CNN, for this reason, in November, the photos of five officers 
 Generals of the Armed Forces have been spread from the far right with the 
 phrase: "General-anthug that prevented military intervention"(angurie,
cioè "verdi fuori, rosse all'interno")</p>
<p>The Ultra-Crazy Journalist William Waack also reports that, according to 
 ACFA sources, the generals basically have two opinions on 
 Elections: a part, frankly minority, believes that there have been 
 electoral fraud, and the vast majority considers - literally - that 
 "The elections were strange", that is, that there would have been an interference 
 of the Supreme Court in the electoral process and before it in favor of Lula. </p>
<p>In being all true - and nothing indicates that it is a whole lie - it is 
 of a strong message: the reactionary armed forces are, in fact, convinced that 
 they may have to complete a military coup, and divergence 
 lies in the definition of the moment and the situation. After all, the logic 
 he says that if the ACFA had considered a principle of non -intervention, not 
 would have discussed as the possibility(per non parlare della difesa esplicita,
sempre fatta in caserma, anche pubblicamente, che le Forze Armate avrebbero un
mandato per intervenire)</p>
<p>The fact is that the majority of the ECFA - hegemonic right - does not want to

 for this reason, General Braga Netto advised camps who asked for 
 Military coup in Brasilia waiting and "not losing faith"? </p>
<p>According to CNN, for this reason, in November, photos of five general officers 
 of the Armed Forces were released by the far right with the sentence: 
 "Watermelon generals that prevented military intervention"(melancias, quer dizer,
"verde por fora, vermelho por dentro"). </p>
<p>Ultra -journal journalist William Waack also reports that, according to 
 sources in the ACFA, generals have, fundamentally, two opinions on 
 Elections: A part, frankly minority, considers that there was fraud 
 electoral, and the vast majority considers - in literal words - that " 
 elections were strange, "that is, that there was an interference with the STF in the 
 electoral process and before him in favor of Lula. </p>
<p>Being all true - and nothing indicates that everything is a lie - it is 
 A strong message: The reactionary armed forces are, in fact, 
 that they may have to culminate a military coup, and the divergence is 
 Definition as to the moment and situation. After all, the logic says that if it works 
 considered a principle to non-intervention, would not have discussed it as 
 possibility(sem mencionar a defesa explícita, desde sempre feita na
caserna, inclusive publicamente, de que as Forças Armadas supostamente têm
mandato para intervir). </p>
<p>The fact is that most of the hegemonic ACFA - not want to make mistakes <em>TIM</em> 
 <em>ing</em>, because a hasty military coup can raise a sea of pasta in 
 response and harm your counterrevolutionary plan to recognize 
 Armed forces as a moderating power, condition to better combat the masses 
 revolutionaries that will inevitably subscribe. But just as you know that 
 cannot miss <em>tim</em> <em>ing</em>, it is also convinced that, soon 
 That late, you will have to launch yourself in the culmination of the coup d'état. This is because 
 Reactionary armed forces are, in Brazil, not only the old marrow of the old state 
 which they maintain, are also tutors of this state and its shift governments 
 And they are intended from the whole nation.
Army Commander, Julio César Arruda, for insubordination when refusing 
 comply with the President of the Republic, and the replacement for the new 
 Commander Tomás Miguel Ribeiro Paiva are being used, once again, to 
 deceive the public opinion that the country is experiencing normality. Far from it, the 
 Brazil is facing the largest military crisis of the last 35 years. </p>
<p>Thus, it is completely stupid to believe that the appointment of this or that general 
 with lamb skin to the position of commander can transform nature 
 same as the forces - whose acfa is even formed in the same booklet and courses 
 defined by the military regime, courses that the government of opportunism, in more than 
 14 years of management, never had chest to change, and will not do it now. 
 This coup movement, which now all see, was conceived in the ACFA as 
 preventive response to the likely revolutionary popular survey 
 political rot, as part of the decomposition of the economic base to which 
 the secularly currently exploitation and oppression system, and that the rebellions of 
 2013/14 foreshadowed to occur. He came to light in 2015 with the Crusade 
 anti -corruption, at first encouraged by Rede Globo with his <em>ode</em> to Lava 
 Jet, and now it already gives your first sighs of adulthood. There is no medicine that 
 Give it: you need to bury it. </p>
<p>All democrats and revolutionaries must have in course that it is necessary 
 combine the complaint with the mass mobilization, to educate them in the spirit of 
 ensure their democratic freedoms as the eye girl, because they are the 
 better conditions for defending your most felt interests. This is only 
 possible by raising them in defense of their basic interests, by 
 to start the reaction improvements in their living conditions through the 
 land in the field, strikes and marches in cities, finally, in the class struggle: there 
 will learn to unmask high -boots scammers, who eat at the same table 
 of the explorers and looters of the people and the nation as they belch patriotism 
 Cheap to the mesmerized small bourgeoisie. In addition, and especially: it is 
 I need to instruct the masses, especially the workers, peasants, youth 
 and small owners who can have everything they want today and a lot 
 more with political power in the hands, torn to the force of his tormentors, in the struggle 
 prolonged and full of adventures, by the democratic, agrarian and anti-anti-revolution

<p><a href="Images/niunamenos.jpg">!No more complacency with femicide!
 one</a>](https://www.revolucionobrera.com/wp-
content/uploads/2023/01/niunamenos.jpg)Demonstration in Argentina against the 
 Feminicide </p>
<p>A week after the feminicide of Valentina Trespalacios, the town is witness 
 of a new one: in the La Virginia neighborhood of the municipality of Pitalito(Huila), a 
 Little 10 -year -old was killed by an ex -convict accused of the crime of abuse 
 sexual. Jonathan Francisco García Tapias according to the media 
 Bourgeois, he was surprised by the grandmother of the girl Maria Camila when 
 He tried to abuse her, immediately Mrs. Luz Marina Valderrama tried 
 defend her granddaughter, so this rapist murdered the little girl and caused 
 Serious wounds to his grandmother. </p>
<p>With anger and tears in my eyes I encourage myself to write about these cases, about 
 Everything, after knowing that the trial for feminicide could be declared void 
 starring John Poulos murderer of Valentina, by leguleyadas, such as 
 There are problems with the translator used by bourgeois justice, then, 
 Supposedly, the unfortunate does not understand what charges they accuse him. The 
 Feminicide has only one language worldwide, it is the conception imposed 
 For bourgeois ideology that women are sexual to the 
 Men's service, in addition to being their property. </p>
<p>The worst of all is that in Colombia the femicides are condemned, 
 we are supposedly sheltered by law before a violation, before the 
 aggression and threat, but reality shows how far we are from it; 
 Femicide figures abound, or say those of rapes, beating and 
 Maltrates, women and girls are the target of feminicides, rapists and 
 stalkers without happening more, and unfortunately, the cases of Mary 
 Camila and Valentina are sample buttons: release a rapist and 
 the possibility of releasing a feminicide by a simple legal procedure of 
 translation, as if we did not know that this murderer becomes the asshole and has 
 Very clear that Valentina murdered without any consideration. </p>
<p>Companions, today as for several months I am convinced of the call 
 UOC made(mlm)to build the revolutionary female movement; is 
 a duty as a woman to help in this purpose, the life of our girls and 
 women cannot depend on the justice and the formality of our executioners, 
 that is, of the institutions of the bourgeois state, that through their 
 Military and judicial forces has also killed, raped and revictimized 
 hundreds of women. </p>
<p>It was time to organize partners, there are many claims that 
 We have to conquer, the way to go to achieve our 
 Freedom, which is part of the release of all exploited and oppressed. 
 I do want to fight for life!, I do want to fight for the rights of 
 Women!Yes I want to unleash my anger in a fair cause!, that tending to 
 End all this because today makes us cry our dead. </p>
<p>THE INVITE COMPANIONS TO CONTRIBUTE IDEAS IN THE CAT OF THIS DIGITAL PORTAL 
 or in your email to consolidate a platform for the fight of this movement, 
 Let's build among all our specifications, where the objective is not negotiable 
 to fight the real cause of our oppression and exploitation: the system 
 imperialist capitalist and his rotten bourgeois state. This knot in my throat 
 It will become a battle cry within the female movement 
 Revolutionary. Companions: Let's join for this cry to become 
 Organized Revolutionary Force!</p>
<h4>Not one less!If you touch one, we all answer!We demand justice</h4>
<p>For Valentina and María Camila!</p>

<p>For revolutionary political prisoners, 41bis is applied with one 
 function of revenge towards those who do not repent, who claim theirs 
 revolutionary militancy(come appunto Alfredo Cospito), and with a function 
 deterrent also towards the outside. </p>
<p>The bourgeois state, governments want to impose their <strong> "peace inside and outside 
 social "even more today in the crisis phase, participation in the war 
 Inter imperialist, and even more today by a Meloni government </strong> 
 modern fascist who aims to also upset constitutional rights, which 
 makes it stay in one's breast(parlamento, Camera, Senato, governo)personages 
 declaredly fascists, in open contrast to the same laws 
 anti -fascist, anti -racist; and that now with the new next rules of the min. 
 of justice wants to continue to cover corrupt politicians, the fascists, the 
 "legal" criminality. </p>
<p>The same capture of Messina Denaro is used to strengthen and give new 
 legitimacy to the regime of 41bis and the obstacle life imprisonment, always putting 
 on the same floor(vedi le dichiarazioni di Nordio sulle intercettazioni), 
 mafia and terrorism, clearly meaning by "terrorism" organizations, 
 the struggles of the revolutionaries, of the communists, to overthrow with all the weapons 
 This capitalist system, its state, to its governments necessary. </p>
<p>The repression that this state has been carrying for some time and always advances 
 more to hit the struggles and their avant -gardes that come out of the limits 
 imposed by bourgeois legislation, finds its tip of icebergs towards i 
 political prisoners; that is, towards those who, in various ways, with which you can be 
 agree or not(noi non siamo d'accordo con gli anarchici con la loro
visione strategica, la loro politica e spesso anche la loro pratica), bridge of 
 made the truth, it needs the armed struggle against a state that attacks i 
 rights of the majority of the masses, of the proletarians, from the most elementary ones
The more general ones, a state that today drags us into the war. </p>
<p><strong> but on the one hand this state with repression is strong, on the other, 
 Precisely for this reason, it shows that he is afraid of the mere fact that he alludes 
 to a radical change of this society. </strong> </p>
<p>In this context, the statement of the state against Alfredo Cosenza must be seen. 
 That, let's not forget, he already took the sentence for injuries in Genoa 
 Ansaldo Manager Roberto Adinolfi, and is now accused of having placed 
 of the bomb packages in front of the school students of the carabinieri of Fossano that 
 They have not caused neither deaths nor injuries. But this is considered massacre 
 Policy against the state and for this you want to segregate it for life. His 
 fault is aggravated by the fact that he continues to fight with the hunger strike 
 And in this sense it is a living indication not to bend. </p>
<p>The 41bis regime, we rightly called it "white torture", is a 
 360 degree isolation, not only with the outside with their family members, but 
 also within the prison with the other prisoners. It is forbidden to receive 
 mail, books, it is also forbidden to greet yourself between prisoners, there is in fact the ban 
 of communication, of word. </p>
<p>This is to kill a person. And rightly so -called in one of his letter he has 
 Written: "<strong> Life does not make sense in this grave for living". </strong> </p>
<p>But once again the state, bourgeois justice as well as reactionary, 
 repressive, <strong> is also "stupid" </strong>: he wanted to silence an anarchist and 
 he raised a stone that is still falling on his feet, the story 
 of Alfredo, with his indomitable hunger strike, has become of domination 
 audience, has aroused vast solidarity also from very different realities, 
 Many and continuous initiatives, events. </p>
<p>Today this mobilization must be continued, developed even more, extended, 
 using various means and forms, investing from any reality to fight to 
 sincere democrats, and bringing it more and more among the popular masses, i 
 workers explaining why this repression concerns all those who do 
 rebel, who fight against the existing state, and that the repression of the 
 Bourgeois state to the revolutionaries is the central part of the class war between 
 proletarians, popular masses and masters, state, governments at the service of this 
 system of exploitation, lack of work, war, misery, of 
 Attack on civil rights and democracy itself. </p>
<p>All solidarity are important, but we want in this battle 
 especially the <strong> solidarity that respects what the same wrote 
 Alfredo Cosito </strong>: _ "Until the end against 41bis and life imprisonment 
 Hindu ":" I opposed all my forces to forced nutrition. They will be 
 Forced to bind me to bed ... to their ruthlessness and fury opposing 
 my strength, tenacity and the will of an anarchist and revolutionary 
 self conscious...". _ </p>
<p>Our password is, therefore, <strong> "Outside Alfredo so far from 41 bis, no 
 obstacle life imprisonment; save life and its political identity ". </strong> </p>
<p>This is today what must be achieved in all possible ways. 
 We have to win this battle of Alfredo, with Alfredo. 
 If we win we will have taken a step forward for the fight against this state 
 Borghese killer.</p>

 they bring their experience on a stage, their fight to defend theirs 
 job, their work, their life, the transformation that takes place 
 When you put your own life into play by participating directly in 
 a fight ... "until that moment arrives you don't know what pasta you are done", 
 Dario says at the beginning of the representation. </p>
<p>Pieces of capital is the direct story of the GKN workers of their struggle 
 triggered by the collective layoffs that left on 9 July 2019 - why i 
 Masters aim at greater profits with relocations - but the workers 
 resist, they don't want to give in to the masters, they spontaneously arrive in 
 hundreds in front of the closed gate and Forzano, they manage to open with 
 the collective force. </p>
<p>Pieces of capital is the struggle that thinks the mists that surround the relationships 
 social and production under the capital that he finds at the market, buy and use 
 the workers' workforce to derive a value, "dead work that dominates e 
 sucks the Live Work Forces "(Marx)A way of organizing the production that 
 The workers want to "question the foundations". </p>
<p>Pieces of capital is the workers' struggle that attracts the solidarity of many 
 components of the company. </p>
<p>Pieces of capital is the small-bourgeois intellectual who puts himself to 
 provision of the workers' cause, makes investigation, represents it according to his 
 Tools and, to do it, goes to live inside the factory, participate directly 
 to the garrison. And begins to hate his class of belonging more and more e 
 It also transforms, and takes on the point of view of the revolution. </p>
<p>Pieces of capital are the fragments of the imposing and revolutionary work of 
 Marx that the intellectual leads to the representation, which could be a 
 stage of a theater inside a house of the people, an occupied space, 
 A factory in struggle. </p>
<p>But ... towards these workers "who have not read Marx's capital" you don't have to 
 Leave them to this stadium, the intellectual, to actually be to theirs 
 service, must explain to the workers the laws of capital, that capital does not 
 It is the single master as it is described in the representation, that Marx does not 
 is limited to the class struggle but it is the awareness of the need for his 
 revolutionary reversal that pushes the struggle forward, which indicates the way 
 output to tiredness, defeats, errors. Can you tell you where to go. 
 "We arise" must first of all be appeal to all workers, 
 organize them, make them return to being a class and a class that "must 
 direct everything ". Otherwise what sense to mention Marx when he defines the 
 Workers like "capital reckless"? </p>
<p>The subtitle of pieces of capital is "a book that we have not yet read": 
 "The problem is that we have not read it 
 If we read it, we didn't understand it 
 If we understood it we don't know what to do 
 If we know what to do, then, we can't do it 
 The problem is that we don't have time 
 The problem is that we don't know where to go " </p>
<p>The worker Dario at the end says: "The only defeat would be to get out of this 
 Fight with a wrong analysis. " </p>
<p>The avant -garde workers, as seen, ask for more than "pieces of capital" 
 The entire theoretical work of Marx, a Marxist working training to orientate 
 and direct. We agree with Dario, when in the end he says: "Let's choose the 
 good companions of life and struggle, and let's try not to live in vain and not 
 die alone. "With Marx we give meaning to the appeal of this worker struggle which is 
 "We arise": that of the objective of the worker power. </p>
<p>Thanks to the company that made the show.</p>

<p>Meloni signs with Descalzi, Eni, an agreement called "historical" on the skin of 
 Migrants: five ships(finanziate dall'Ue)to the Libyan Coast Guard for the 
 "control" of refugees fleeing from violence and hunger, in exchange for a historian 
 gas agreement of 8 billion dollars. </p>
<p>«We talked about how to enhance the tools to fight flows 
 illegal. It is a theme that does not only concern Italy and Libya, it must concern 
 The European Union as a whole », repeats Meloni. Then it's up to Tajani: «I have 
 signed a memorandum in agreement between the Italian and the Libyan government for the 
 Delivery of five lookouts financed by the EU. We strengthen cooperation 
 With Libya, also to counteract irregular immigration flows ». </p>
<p>The strengthening of the infamous Libyan coast guard, denounced by 
 migrants for the violence, the arrests, will lead to prevent the force that i 
 migrants can escape from horror or to bring them back to the concentration camps of the 
 torture, rapes of women. </p>
<p><strong> Migrants, men, women, children are sacrificed, delivered to 
 "Boia" for, in the classic imperialist politics, to have business in exchange. </strong> </p>
<p>Meloni recalled how «Eni has been present here since 1959, has in fact 
 contributed to an important part of the Libyan history of these years, of 
 Economic development of Libya ... ". demonstrating how imperialist Italy is 
 was an accomplice of the horrors perpetrated in Libya by American imperialism e 
 Today of the Lager politics, torture of the current regime towards migrants, 
 for the profits of Italian capitalism. </p>
<p>And Meloni explains the <strong> neo colonial policy of his government, that </strong> <strong> takes 
 Energy resources and leaves crumbs in the North Africa countries </strong>: «Italy 
 He wants to play an important role, also in the ability to help countries 
 Africans to grow and become richer. A cooperation that does not want

 Ghana, the economy <strong> "with the most rapid growth of the world </strong>" ... <strong> in December 
 2022 </strong>, with three years of pandemic behind it ...: <strong> Third African country finished 
 in default </strong> from the beginning of the Covid emergency ". </p>
<p>Speaking of failures, if the IMF is assessed for his 
 Forecast would have failed for some time!But here it is not a question of 
 forecast_ of the IMF, but as you know <em>Dell 'intervention</em> of this body 
 international financial in the hands of imperialism, which with his 
 Included analyzes rather conveys its "desires". </p>
<p>The type of intervention <em>Classico</em> is that of the "exchange" between loans and 
 <strong> obligation to renovate </strong> economic and political internal to the country that of 
 rule turns into a cutting public spending for pensions, health, school 
 etc. with a strong worsening of the conditions of the popular masses; in this 
 in case this article of the Sole 24 Ore of 22 explains it in part 
 January that reports the statements of the IMF that <strong> a few days before </strong> 
 of the "Ghana bankruptcy" had granted a <strong> 3 billion </strong> loan of 
 dollars <strong> to keep its economy </strong> ... and together with Ghana there is <strong> lo 
 Zambia in 2020 </strong> and <strong> Mali in the same 2022 </strong> ... but overall, second 
 "A reconnaissance of the chatham house, a British Think Tank": "countries 
 Africans in one or the other situation <strong> are 22 </strong> ". </p>
<p>"In absolute value - says the Confindustria newspaper - La <strong> Mole 
 debt </strong> has risen five times between 2000 and 2020, touching <strong> 696 
 billions of dollars </strong> in the year of explosion of Covid: <strong> a figure that 
 It overcomes, alone, the aggregate GDP of 40 African economies. "</strong> out of 54 countries 
 overall <strong>. </strong> </p>
<p>That this debt is "<strong> unsustainable </strong>" the same is the same and the other 
 organism in the hands of imperialism, the World Bank: "The monetary fund 
 International and the World Bank estimate that <strong> 60% of low economies 
 income takes place, already today, an unsustainable debt or close to 
 Become it in close times </strong> ". </p>
<p>Which imperialist countries have this debt in their hands? </p>
<p>"China holds a slice of 13%, according to an elaboration of the center 
 Bo Global Development Center Studies. Another 15% goes to bilateral debts, the 
 12% to commercial banks, 27% in market bonds and 32% in 
 loans contracts with multilateral institutions. "Conditions that" ... do 
 fear a swing of insolvenze quickly. The public debt of 
 South Africa, ivory coast and Kenya is increasing by 14.1 respectively, 
 17,6 and 10.3 percentage points compared to GDP in the three -year period concluded in 2022, 
 detects chatham house. Now, he adds, <strong> there is the risk that "the situation 
 debt can still worsen in 2023 »." </strong> </p>
<p>Worse than that? Of course, given that the intervention of the imperialist countries, states 
 United, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, China, Russia ... it is not limited to 
 "economic" factor means feeding monoculture, corruption 
 of the bourgeoisie Compradora, the internal wars in progress(anche qui per
interposta persona)with relative push for military expenditure, military presence 
 foreign, imposing internal emigration and to imperialist countries ... and in 
 this case to stroke about emigration from Africa without taking into account 
 these objective conditions, of the oppression of imperialism, means not 
 understand what we are talking about ... </p>
<p>To these "causes" would still add the "same factors they hold 
 Under check the world economy "and that is" war in Ukraine "" inflation and 
 Energy and food prices "and relative" insecurity crisis 
 food that looms on over 140 million people "and again 
 "strengthening of the dollar which caused the increase in interests on the 
 debt that in Nigeria, as "relationship between the expenses for the dismissal of the 
 debt and export entrances, the so -called <em>DEBT Service Ratio</em>, flew 
 Over 102% in 2022. "In short, all revenue from 
 export of oil, of which Nigeria is one of the main producers, 
 To repay the debt!</p>
<p>The overall picture of the ongoing disaster is clear!At this point yes 
 he should ask how these countries will get out of the disaster, and instead the 
 Question that the Sole24ore journalist is asking is "<strong> Which will be the next 
 Countries to slip in default </strong>. Pangea-Risk, an intelligence company, 
 provides that at least six countries of the sub -Sasaharan region will be called <strong> a 
 renovate your debt </strong> by 2024, a list that also includes
'Egypt <strong>, the most populous country of northern Africa, is ballast from 
 almost </strong> 158 billion dollars in foreign debt <strong> and is counterattack with the 
 I do a package of financing of 5-6 billion dollars. "But it's not over 
 Here, because even "other scenarios are also more <em>tranchant</em> ... the agency 
 of rating S&amp;P identifies four African economies, on 24 under its own 
 lens, "vulnerable" to default in 2023 </strong>(Burkina Faso, Congo-Brazzaville,
Etiopia e Mozambico)<strong>, aligning themselves with the two who have already suffered the same 
 fate </strong>(Ghana e Zambia<strong> : il </strong>Mali<strong> è fuori dai radar di S&amp;P)Widen 
 the evaluation to other criteria, the total of cases in the balance can 
 multiply to at least </strong> 18 countries unable to honor their debts <strong>. " 
 "Only between 2022 and 2024, according to Pangea-Risk, will expire </strong> debts for 
 185 billion dollars **. If the size of the problem are clear, it is not 
 the way to cushion the impact of a crisis that can overwhelm more countries 
 of how already they are already under observation. " </p>
<p>But an "solution" of his imperialism finds it!"An invoked solution - 
 The article continues - It is the <em>DEBT RELLEF</em>, the <strong> partial or total amnesty </strong> 
 that would lighten the debt load on the shoulders of even more economies 
 hit from international turbulence. " </p>
<p>And it would not be at all of news, given that it is an already adopted maneuver 
 in the past, and that <strong> has not solved or could solve </strong> the problems of the countries 
 oppressed by imperialism!<strong> On the contrary </strong>, it is a maneuver to keep cheated and 
 linked to themselves these countries that continue to provide above all subjects 
 First low cost!</p>
<p>But who should "lighten" the debt? "<strong> The eyes are focused on 
 China </strong>, but an impact maneuver would require an agreement between Beijing and <strong> le 
 Western institutions that hold even greater debt shares </strong>. The 
 Meeting last December between FMI, World Bank and China closed with 
 Spiragli of optimism "but, as the president of the IMF says, Kristalina 
 Georgieva, "there were no accelerations or net hypotheses 
 on the emergency. " </p>
<p>All imperialist optimism ends in the possibility of a "platform 
 To face "systematically" debt issues, outlining a 
 «Active role of China», in addition to a more robust push on the Common Framework 
 of the G20: an initiative of the <strong> Club of rich economies </strong> <strong> to provide 
 solutions to poor countries </strong> who find themselves on the shoulders debt in 
 suffering. "It is for all this that the bomb that could burst is not alone 
 that of the debt!Imperialism produces "failed states" </p>
<p>In short, "the road is long" says the sun24ore: «It will take <strong> weather </strong>, one 
 certain <strong> luck </strong> [just like that!] And the <strong> support of the creditors themselves 
 current </strong> ... "that is, of the same imperialist countries(che si "accorgono" di
questi Paesi quando non possono più pagare gli interessi sui prestiti)but what 
 They will endeavor because in the end "Africa is a huge opportunity". </p>
<p>The proletarians and popular masses of Africa must transform this 
 "enormous opportunity" for their class interests because "the same causes 
 economic and social that push the imperialists to robbery wars, 
 they become unlivable material conditions, unbearable for the slaves of the 
 capital, material conditions for the rebellion of proletarians, peoples, 
 of nations and countries exploited and oppressed by monopolies and countries 
 Imperialists. " </p>
<p>And once again it is necessary to remind us that "it is up to the communist movement 
 International bring them revolutionary consciousness, organize e 
 transform the rebellions into a revolutionary struggle against the common enemy: the 
 World capitalist system of oppression and exploitation. "( <em>Dichiarazione

<h2>LLL 2023: "Long live the International Communist League!"</h2>
<p><img alt="" width="800px" src="Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_header.png" />This year again the LLL demonstration took place in Berlin in January. While
this annual event is primarily a showdown of the various forces of the
revolutionist movement in the FRG, this year the Maoists had a different
message: the International Communist League - ICL was founded!A manifold
international contingent proclaimed this historic message at the
demonstration, fulfilling the demand that had been made in the previous years
at the same demonstration - also in the struggle: For the new organization of
the international proletariat!</p>
<p><img alt="LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund
1" src="Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_1.png" />This message was not only powerfully spread, but also joyfully accepted by
many masses. Several times masses asked for the flags of the ICL, which were
carried on the demonstration in four languages - Spanish, English, Turkish and
German. Some even wanted to buy them on the spot. An excerpt of the ICL's
Political Declaration and Principles was distributed as a leaflet, and
Partizan comrades handed out printed brochures with the Declaration in English
and Turkish. Thus, the radiance that the LLL demonstration has in the FRG and
parts of Western Europe was used to celebrate and spread this success of the
Maoists.</p>
<p><img alt="LLL Demonstration 2023 Internationaler Kommunistischer Bund
2" src="Images/LLL_Demonstration_2023_Internationaler_Kommunistischer_Bund_-_2.png" />The participants of the contingent look now full of joy and proletarian
optimism into the future to develop under new, better conditions the work for
the goal of the communists - the communism - and the unification of the
International Communist Movement to push further.</p>

Philippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>January 30, 2023</strong></p>
<p>We condemn the Philippine National Police(PNP)for the unlawful and baseless
arrest of retired NDFP consultant, Ruben Abenir Saluta, 75 years old, literary
writer and newspaperman, together with wife Presentacion Saluta and a female
companion identified as Yvonne Losaria, last night in Doña Soledad, Barangay
Labangal, General Santos City.</p>
<p>Saluta, who is frail and suffering from hypertension, as well as from chronic
pulmonary disease, has long retired from active duty since being released from
imprisonment after cases against him and his wife were dismissed from 2016 to
2019. Presentacion, likewise, suffers from hypertension and heart disease.</p>
<p>We condemn the police for planting firearms and explosives against Saluta et
al.</p>
<p>The Party supports the call for the immediate release of Saluta and company.</p>
<p>The Party denounces the gross inhumane treatment of the elderly
revolutionaries who have lived lives in service of the oppressed and exploited
masses.</p>
<p>We call on human rights defenders, as well as journalists and cultural workers
to come to the aid of Saluta and raise the demand for their immediate freedom!</p>

 Police of via Cagni, where 700 people had concentrated for the practices of 
 immigration and kindergarten, the police fired tear me to disperse 
 people waiting for the opening of the offices where there were some 
 tensions. </p>
<p>Some of these had camped from Friday waiting for the

<p>There are three migrants, two of 25 years and one of 38, medicated since 118, and two of 
 They were brought to the emergency room for bruises and bruising. </p>

<p>"The criminalization process of immigration has been underway for decades and yes 
 sometimes subtlely manifest in language, in the formulation of the rules, 
 in the representation of the migratory phenomenon, other times in a plastic way, 
 violent and shameless, as happened in front of the offices of the police headquarters of

 an acrobatic rebound of responsibility, the discharge on people who,

<p>"We remember that this situation has been created since the offices are 
 were transferred to via Cagni decentralizing them with respect to the office of the office

 launched with the beginning of the new year after a first and disastrous experiment 
 carried out on 22 December 2022, it provides that 120 questions are collected to

 resolved the matter because the delay accumulated in a year and a half has 
 created a quantity of aspiring asylum seekers much greater than that 
 that these numbers can absorb ", concludes Radice.</p>

<h1>PC January 30: our central work continues in large factories. Mirafiori: the voices of the workers and our indications and proposals: anti -capitalist proletarian assembly in Rome February 18, assembly of workers in Turin in the week of 8 March</h1>
<!--METADATA-->

<p>Initiative in Mirafiori to the concierge, with posting posters with the 
 Our indications and flags of the Slai Cobas alongside. They spread 
 flyers, also distributed for direct contact and an exchange with 
 workers and workers who enter and leave the concierge for the first and 
 second round. </p>
<p>Learned that the workers of the central shift were also at work that day 
 of the Maserati, we returned to 16.00 for the exit. This allowed to 
 also speak with the workers of this department on the general situation and on 
 company contract where information and perspective is missing. </p>
<p>During the morning the news had spread that in May they close the 
 Incentives for Lear(sedili)to send away and that there will be workers in the middle 
 to the street, and there was a bad mood. </p>
<p>The billboards, seen and read in several cases evidently, have become 
 opportunity to start talking "is no longer life, war and caravan, the 
 Single contract for the whole group "; the flags have attracted attention, 
 It was in fact, as someone said "the day of the Cobas". </p>
<p>This was clear from the first worker who when he saw us prepare the 
 billboards, a little surprised, we said "I didn't think there were still 
 These initiatives no longer have these initiatives in Mirafiori "; 
 We explained that our intervention is precisely because we do not have 
 Alternatives. </p>
<p>Others, seeing the flags said: "I was also cobas ... there were also 
 The Cobas at the time of the strikes for the Panda(2002 circa)but then with i 
 solidarity contracts no longer made them enter ... ";" There were also i 
 Cobas when the processions were there, the Cobas now are the 'to slap those 
 Stayed, there are eliminated people, put out ... ". </p>
<p>Several other workers spoke of this presence passed in various ways 
 "I was also cobas, you're right, now I read carefully ... 
 Angry and resigned it is not good, you have to be combative ... no I don't 
 give up ". </p>
<p>The guardians are very evident, who as usual observe the movement of 
 workers around us, and in front of the concierge the workers were more 
 elusive, and a couple of workers have explicitly said. </p>
<p>In general, the workers wanted to speak, and some were 
 clearly critical of the confederal unions, the delegates "who are 
 'sitting not to do anything "compared to what happens in the factory;" We 
 We have already told the unions inside our problems, but that much does not 
 they can do. </p>
<p>Faced with the renovation of the group, the caravan, the war, to 
 Meloni government, the proposal of the workers' assembly is the one necessary for 
 unite, organize, give perspective to the workers who want in factories 
 oppose. For this we brought the indication to the signs and in the flyer 
 of the new <strong> Anti -capitalist proletarian assembly that will take place in Rome on 18 
 January.</strong> </p>

 Fund, you know, it is fear, the strike is no longer done. If we do the 
 strikes, pay the consequences. Come and do the worst jobs, a 
 part that there is nor nor, but all of them must be rebelled 
 Together ... outside here we have a life, a house ". </p>
<p>Other workers and workers confirm: "Yes, more and more, I have been working for 30 years, 
 I arrive from Grugliasco who closed, I ruined my back in line, 
 do not take into consideration the problems, but at the end of the month you have to pay 
 The rent ... ";" After 30 years of work you don't even have the health that takes care of you. 
 If you don't have the money, you have time to die ... ";" They don't send us retired and 
 inside young people, I am 30 years of work but I have never worked as now, 
 on the assembly line "," ... it's not that we are so young that they can be 
 on assembly lines; I drive the cart, unloading truck from the morning 
 In the evening, at 56 years old I think I have already given ";" Too much work, too loaded 
 of work, first 10 pieces, now 15. But there are many workers at home!Self 
 They divided the work would be better, all the load to us, we will die before "; 
 "Higher rhythms yes, but also targeted loads to force you to </p>
<p>accept the resignation ";" I work three days a week, but there is no 
 I do more. I see that others in other factories are worse than us, rhythms 
 of work, Amazon, Pirkinton ... arrived at a certain age you need to 
 slow down. We have to get out of here. "Left" and right have reduced us to 
 This state ... ".
an alternative, we are not here to tell the workers, but to work together 
 to build the way out. </p>
<p>We talk about preparing an assembly to join the workers who are not there to 
 This life, but we must build it together. The workers are not there more 
 As you work in the factory, but complaining or protesting one by one, 
 We work together for <strong> an assembly of workers in the week of 8 
 March. </strong> </p>
<p>Other workers strengthen the complaint of factory conditions and how yes 
 It is treated: "It's sucks, I have the 7 year old girl don't even give me the 
 days, they make me the proposals: if you come to me on a Saturday or two I will come to you 
 I find. They want me to go for 18 compulsory Saturdays, up to 
 September ... Meeting? I have the 7 year old girl and I have to work, one day 
 I come here and the girl I leave her to the cage and I enter work!It's right?" </p>
<p>We reply: "How they treat you, you are right to rebel, but it is right that the 
 Do you protest her alone? And the other workers? Because you don't do it together, 
 And does your little girl become our struggle? There are the possibilities if the 
 we are looking for ... we have to overturn this situation, because even to obey 
 You don't save you the same, targeted rhythms and loads, it is a factory that you 
 crushed. "she reflects on the collective size of the protest" yes 
 True, it can be done, and for the assembly I speak with the colleagues in the ward ". </p>
<p>Other rumors about the fight: "I came from Rivalta, I made a strike, 
 They were all who cried, I went out on my own ... we went out to do the 
 processions but nothing has changed ";" Nobody is more willing to put strike, or if 
 You do one then they don't go further, the bills have increased, the people 
 In here they are not willing to lose money. I have seen struggles but 
 Nothing has changed. Grugliasco, Rivalta, Maserati ... have closed ";" But the 
 Pensions, health care have brought them the workers with the struggle ... ". </p>
<p>It is not enough to make only the list of misfortunes, first when the workers had 
 In their hands the struggle, the worker movement filled these avenues, we must 
 try again. The strength of the workers is when they organize themselves for their own 
 interests. For this we must build an autonomous assembly.</p>

<p><strong> Ukraine. </strong> In the course of the War of Occupation of Russian Imperialism in 
 Ukraine, the blood hands of Yankee and German imperialism continue 
 supporting kyiv's Nazi government prolonging the butcher shop, where the only ones 
 victims are workers and peoples. The reactionary governments of 
 USA and Germany have announced the sending of war tanks to support the 
 Zelensky puppet. These are 14 Leopard-2 tanks(Alemania)and 31 tanks 
 Abrams(EE.UU.)which would be added to the 14 challenger tanks(Inglaterra)that had been announced previously. This war conflict over the 
 new distribution of areas of influence in Europe seeks to spring 
 general crisis of imperialism and its effect is precisely the opposite, because 
 In addition to the obvious hardships of the imperialist war on the 
 Territories in dispute, the standard of living of the masses in other countries is 
 deteriorates even more with the rise in the cost of living, speculation, 
 exploitation and misery. We must remember that there are no imperialisms 
 Good, all powers and super powers have stained hands of 
 Blood of the working class and the oppressed peoples. Below imperialisms 
 Yankee and Russian!Down with kyiv's Nazi government!Below the imperialist war!</p>

<p><strong> Palestine. </strong> A new massacre was recorded in the West Bank occupied in a 
 Refugee Camp in Jenin. The Fascist-Sionist Army of Occupation 
 broke on January 26 by launching a huge amount of gases 
 tearful against a pediatric hospital -which forced the evacuation of 
 The children-, while he made an innumerable amount of arms shots 
 of fire against the population. Israel justified this incursion by saying that 
 He tried "an anti -terrorism operation." At least 9 Palestinians were 
 killed by the Israeli army, among fatalities are 
 Magda Obaid, a 61 -year -old woman who died of a shot in the neck. 
 Dozens of Palestinians were injured or intoxicated with gases. 
 Parallel in Jerusalem, a tenth Palestinian was killed by the Army 
 Zionist. As a result, various resistance factions 
 Palestine have sworn that they will avenge the martyrs. At the moment Israel has more 
 of 30 Palestinians killed at this beginning of 2023. </p>

 capital of that country; <a href="https://solrojista.blogspot.com/2020/08/breves-iniciando-

 then</a>The masses have taken the streets at various times 
 denouncing corruption and campaign bureaucracy that derived in that 
 tragedy. After maintaining the investigation for 13 months in suspense, the 
 Last Monday, the case judge resumed the instruction accusing the attorney general 
 and to other senior state officials for obstructing investigations; in 
 Answer the Prosecutor's Office has initiated an investigation against the judge for 
 "Rebellion against justice" and "usurpation", in addition to ordering liberation 
 of all officials arrested for the explosion. Among the detainees already 
 Liberated is Ziad AUF, port official with dual nationality(libanesa-estadounidense)and whereby the US imperialist government

<h1>Lula's visit, Mercosur and Los TLC with China and Europe</h1>
<!--METADATA-->

<p>We said in the 50th anniversary speech of our party, of the 12th of 
 last November, that Lula's triumph against fascist Bolsonaro was a 
 good news for Brazil and the continent, but that ‘’ eye with what 
 We celebrate ’’, since we know him for the previous governments of the PT that in 
 Essence consequently defended the interests of financial capital 
 Brazilian. </p>
<p>In the internal they did not even advance in the deep reforms that the 
 working class and the people to achieve a new society without exploited or 
 exploiters and at most carried out a healthcare policy that 
 It was significant while there were high international prices for their 
 raw Materials. </p>
<p>External these governments positioned themselves, and Lula is openly raised 
 Now again to do it, as a power in this multipolar world, with the 
 Yankee imperialism enemy of our peoples, in decline, 
 China disputing hegemony, Russia invading Ukraine and NATO every day more 
 involved in that war. From that position your government will promote the 
 Celac, Unasur, Mercosur and the possible FTAs and agreements with the others 
 powers </p>
<p>The previous governments of the PT maintained and deepened a policy in the 
 Mercosur that imposed a general deindustrialization in 
 Our country, with the loss of 140,000 jobs in the industry 
 manufacturing of clothing, textile, footwear, metallurgy, 
 appliances, glass, etc., only in the first three years of its 
 functioning. This was what the Astori accountant and the opportunistic sectors 
 of the FA of that time defined as ‘’ a bitter drink ’’ and as inevitable. 
 Another that bitter and long the drink for the working class and the people!</p>
<p>Actually due to unequal capitalist development among the countries of the 
 Mercosur, the great market of this regional and international weight power, 
 much of the region's industry was concentrated there while its 
 monopolies also appropriated these years, in our country, nothing less than 
 Of most refrigerators, rice, beer, gas and 
 They advanced a lot in banking, tanneries, etc. Something that has been happening too 
 although in different ways in the other countries of the region. </p>
<p>Lenin said in his 1915 work on the slogan of the United States of 
 Europe, that «if German monarchies are not overthrow, 
 Austrian and Russian, this slogan is meaningless and is false ». Then 
 pointed out that «from the point of view of the economic conditions of the 
 Imperialism, the United States of Europe are impossible or are 
 reactionaries ’and that“ in capitalism a uniform process of 
 economic development of different economies and different states » 
 that «the inequality of economic and political development is an absolute law 
 of capitalism. " </p>
<p>We say this because what Lula and his opportunistic friends now propose that 
 They aspire to a new FA government, it is more of the same, supposedly to have 
 more in mind the asymmetries in Mercosur, what they practically did not 
 Until now, while a FTA will be negotiated with the European Union and agreements with 
 China but based on the interests of the ruling classes of Brazil. </p>
<p>The Government of Lacalle Pou and its right -wing and ultra -right coalition, raises 
 A NAFTA with China and a flexibility and greater commercial opening of MERCOSUR 
 because in essence the interests of the intermediary bourgeoisie and the 
 estate, and in particular those of agribusiness exporters, which 
 They want to keep some hundred million tariffs they pay 
 now. This at the cost of opening our economy more to monopolies 
 Imperialists, which would imply a new blow to the manufacturing industry, 
 Open even more state companies and public tenders, deliver 
 what is left of the port infrastructure and airports, and 
 important sectors of services. </p>
<p>In the FTAs that are handled so much with the EU, with China and the transpacific, the 
 base would be a new adjustment in the economy, the liquidation of sources of 
 work in the manufacturing industry due to tariffs and greater 
 delivery of national sovereignty. It seems that those are the only options, 
 both for the government and for the opportunist majority of the management of the 
 FA. Marcelo Abdala President of the PIT-CNT decorates this by raising the creation 
 of ‘’ quality work ’, as if no more than three decades had passed 
 This ‘’ integration ’’ at the service of monopolies, that he and his party, the 
 PCU revisionist support and embellish. </p>
<p>In his recent speech of 22/1, when commemorating the 14th anniversary of the State 
 Plurinational of Bolivia, President Luis Arce, made a detailed 
 balance of what was achieved by the economic and social policy of governments 
 arising from the popular and anti -imperialist struggle, which Evo Morales headed and
economic and social plane, were the basis of the nationalization of the 
 Natural resources, hydrocarbons and mining, particularly lithium 
 to which they industrialize in the country imposing strong conditioning on 
 associated foreign companies. </p>
<p>The other policy of great importance that they are developing is that of 
 import substitution, subsidizing and protecting production 
 industrial and agrarian of the country, giving a great example to the continent that there are 
 A sovereign path, which faces the policies that boost organisms 
 imperialists, who try to permanently adjust our economies to the 
 International Labor Division of the Imperialist-Capitalist System 
 prevailing. </p>
<p><strong> Discard the illusions that opportunism sow and prepare a year of 
 Great struggles </strong> </p>
<p>The Government will try to approve the reform of social security reactionary to 
 Short term in the Chamber of Deputies, surveys already reflect a rejection 
 majority of our people to it and it is essential to face it so much 
 With the mobilization as with the plebiscite that ATSS has been promoting(Asociación de Trabajadores de la Seguridad Social)and the MONDESS(Movimiento
en Defensa de la Seguridad Social), where unions come together, currents 
 class union, social organizations and that has the support of 
 Our popular unity. </p>
<p>In a few months the 10th round of salary tips will be carried out, with 
 195 groups, and also the last accountability of the period, events 
 where the working class will attempt a real recovery of wages and 
 Retirements after three years of adjustment and reduce them. </p>
<p>Under these conditions and in the heat of labor struggles it is necessary to strengthen 
 The class groups in the trade union movement, to change the 
 correlation of forces in the PIT-CNT, in whose direction a majority predominates 
 opportunistic, unify the struggles and give them a new perspective to them. </p>
<p><strong> 17th Anniversary of the Popular Unit-AP </strong> </p>
<p>The UP, unitary political-electoral tool on the left 
 radical anti -imperialist and independent of opportunism, will commemorate its 17th 
 Anniversary on April 22 and heads to its 12th National Meeting of 
 Militants, to be held in May, where the situation will be analyzed 
 Political, economic and social of the country, work against the 
 Social Security reform and plebiscite, and work will be directed 
 organizational and alliance policy towards the 2024 elections, with the 
 objective of recovering our presence in Parliament to put it to 
 service of the struggle of our people. </p>
<p>The national coordinator has also agreed to start soon with the 
 programmatic work developing thematic workshops in the area of the 
 Education and environment and advance in organizational tasks. </p>
<p><strong>Put up and fighting!</strong> </p>

<h1>PC January 30 - The war in Ukraine expands to the Middle East: US imperialism and its Israeli guard dog have attacked a military structure of Iran</h1>

<p><strong> Israel helps Ukraine behind the scenes </strong> </p>

 Israel. </p>
<p>Tehran, officially, does not attribute responsibility to the state 
 Jewish. </p>
<p>In Syria Israeli drones against a convoy of arms of the regime militias ad 
 Albukamal </p>
<p>The attack on Isfahan took place less than a week after an important 
 Usa-Israel military exercise in the perspective of the clash against 
 Tehran. </p>
<p>According to Nova Agenzia, the raids took place in six different Iranian cities and more 
 Sometimes the Iranian smuggler has come into operation. The ISW reports that 
 Explosions were heard in Karaj, in the province of Alborz; Dezfoul, 
 Province of Khuzestan; and Hamedan City, province of Hamedan, in the hours 
 following the attack of the drones. </p>
<p>Furthermore, "Iran and Israel have been engaged for years in a shadow war on earth, 
 sea, air and in cyberspazio with Israel who made attacks against 
 Iranian military and nuclear structures made targeted murders with robots 
 remote controlled, hitting scientists and even a high military official, the 
 Colonel Savad Khodayee, head of a secret guards unit 
 Revolutionary. In addition to him, two colonels were killed in accidents. 
 This is what Naftali Bennett, prime minister "rotating" until July 
 2022, had defined "octopus doctrine": hit no longer "tentacles" 
 of the Iranian regime in the region but "go straight to the head". A strategy 
 that the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has just returned to office 
 A month, it may not want to abandon "(da eastjournal)</p>
<p>Amwaj.media: however, speaking on condition of anonymity, a political source 
 high rank in the Iranian capital indicated to Amwaj.Media that 
 <strong> Ukraine was mentioned among the guilty potential </strong>. Echoing this 
 line, the media affiliate of the Supreme Council for National Security 
 Iranian(SNSC)he warned of "heavy consequences" unless the government 
 Ukrainian does not distance himself from the attack. In the meantime, others support 
 that <strong> Azerbaijan </strong>, whose embassy to Tehran has recently been recently 
 closed due to the growing tensions, he may have played a role alongside 
 of Israel. </p>
<p>Sources with "direct knowledge of the attack" of 29 January told a 
 Israeli correspondent of the American outlet Axios that the attack was 
 "specific, surgical and successful", claiming that "4 different areas 
 of the building were accurately targeted and the goal was 
 reached up". </p>

 January 2023 </p>
<p>According to sources of the US press, the attack of three drones to one 
 Military structure of Isfahan took place in recent days is the work of Israel. 
 The Ministry of Defense of Tehran reports that the damage caused were 
 limited. </p>
<p>It is not the first time that Israel affects military structures of the Republic 
 Islamic, but the timing of the attack, with drones, which occurred in the days 
 last suggests a clear message addressed by Tel Aviv to Tehran 
 on the approach that the Jewish state intends to pursue towards the country 
 Shiite, evidently supported by his strictest ally, the United States. 
 It is the Wall Street Journal that supports with certainty that behind the operation
At least 3 drones, one of which capable of reaching the goal, has been achieved 
 A building that, for some analysts, is a weapons deposit, for others a 
 Laboratory or a military logistics site. </p>
<p>Today the journey of the secretary Antony Blinken in 
 Middle East, where he will meet the government representatives of Israel, Palestine 
 and Egypt. A mission to say the least incandescent, with Tel Aviv active 
 militarily not only in Iran but also in the West Bank, where the tension is 
 to the stars. It is the first visit of the Secretary of State since the executive 
 of the far right led by Benjamin Netanyahu has settled, with Washington 
 unable to control the moves of the Israeli ally, free to operate 
 in the international context. The proximity never denied, nor cooled, to the 
 Russia by Vladimir Putin reads the failure to send military supplies 
 to Ukraine, which allowed the Israeli army to continue 
 undisturbed with Strikes in Sovereign territory of Syria(supportata da
Mosca), where the objectives are Iranian military presences. </p>
<p>In fact, there are multiple intertwining related to the Middle Eastern fate, 
 concerning an important slice of international balances. If it opened 
 A wider front of open war, this would drag the community 
 international in the underworld of a military confrontation with unexpected results, 
 which also involves powers with nuclear weapons in this case. Diplomacy 
 seems to be numb in this phase of military actions and violence against civilians, 
 with the European Union that is said ready to insert the guards of the 
 Revolution in the list of terrorist organizations despite the 
 political danger that this choice would cause, or the definitive end 
 of the negotiations for the restoration of the JCPOA, the agreement on Iranian nuclear power. </p>
<p>Yet, openings would come to this sense from the United States, with the 
 Qatar mediation. In fact, Foreign Minister Mohammed Bin 
 Abdulrahman Al-Thani, visiting Tehran, yesterday would have 
 A message from Washington delivered to the Iranian government. "We will do all this 
 that it is possible so that an agreement is reached between Iran and the West, 
 fundamental for regional stability, "said Al-Thani. On the front 
 Saudi, Foreign Minister Faisal Bin Farhan at Saud will go to 
 Next weeks in Baghdad, still a broker for peace between Riad and Tehran, 
 Just to meet the Iranian colleague Hossein Amirabdollahian. </p>
<p>After 5 negotiating rounds with the aim of restoring full relationships between 
 The two countries, the parties have agreed for new meetings. It is always 
 complicated to interpret the moves of the individual actors, regional and non -regional, 
 involved in the stability of the neighbor and the Middle East: from the Iranian presence 
 in the nations bordering Israel to the ambiguity of Saudi Arabia in 
 relationship with Tel Aviv, passing through the role of the United States and Russia, is in 
 dance the stability of international relations which, apparently, rests 
 Still on a strategic region at a geopolitical level.</p>

<h1>PC January 30 - The Meloni government launches another attack on workers' rights: term contracts without limits and without causal</h1>

<p>After the introduction of vouchers with the Budget Law, in the next few days 
 The Meloni government is preparing to make other favors to the masters by freeing them from 
 "constraints" that were placed for fixed -term contracts, constraints often also imposed 
 by court judgments and even by the Constitutional Court which "is already 
 intervened on the Jobs Act of Renzi, to invite Parliament to legislate in 
 more favorable way to workers regarding compensation in cases 
 of layoffs without just cause. "As reported by the manifesto of last 25. </p>
<p>It is clear that the "compensation" were introduced to cushion the blows of the 
 layoffs, but have not compensated and cannot compensate a worker or a 
 worker who loses work!</p>
<p>The new fixed -term contracts should be launched "by 
 The beginning of February: <strong> Via the 12 -month limit for time contracts without 
 causali </strong>, the hypothesis is <strong> return to 36 months, as in the times of the Renzi government </strong> 
 and Minister Poletti. <strong> with the possibility of a further 12 months to be entrusted 
 to collective contracts </strong>. The causals for renewals will also be widening, 
 which today are substantially linked to the replacement of workers e 
 temporary increases in the activity. " </p>

 workers and workers in these conditions, hastens to answer the 
 Minister of Labor(della precarietà e della disoccupazione)Elvira Calderone 
 What a rod, moreover!“" Just consider flexibility only in the key 
 negative, the term contract is not in itself a form of 
 precariousness »" and that, if not? Here the minister also shows loss of

<blockquote>
<p>And in that ride ahead </p>
<p>Without seeking reward </p>

<p>has more strength than the presence </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Queência, time and absence</em>, by Jayme Caetano Braun. </p>
<p>Jayme Caetano Braun(1924-1999)Born in Timbaúva(hoje Bossoroca), then 
 District of São Luiz Gonzaga, one of the seven peoples of the Guarani missions. Son of 
 German Father and Mother India, brought symbolically in the very origin of blood and 
 soil the synthesis of the historical formation of Rio Grande do Sul: </p>
<p>“Paternal grandfather, the colono farmer,/ in the new world, chasing longings;/ grandfather 
 Maternal, the chapter of the Persono,/ Guardian of homeland in the pedestal of Arreios!/ 
 Paternal grandmother, the straight peasant,/ Germana redhead of ancestors inheritances;/ grandmother 
 maternal, the restless peasant,/ loving the earth and cursing the spears ” 
 - Delivered in <strong> _ Estarpe _ </strong>. </p>
<p>Art, context, militancy </p>
<p>Jayme becomes a poet at the same time as he enters adulthood, in the middle of the 
 1940s. Then began, in Rio Grande do Sul as in the country, a 
 crisis time and reaffirmation of an identity threatened by penetration 
 Economic and cultural of imperialism. The exporting landlord model 
 its possibilities of maintaining a minimum degree of 
 cohesion, the agrarian issue became ineludible and the literature reflected these 
 contradictions. In the trilogy composed of <strong> _ without direction _ </strong>(1937), <strong> _ Porteira 
 Closed _ </strong>(1944)E <strong> _ New road _ </strong>(1954), the novelist Cyro Martins 
 denounced that the gaucho, reduced to servitude in the border's estates, 
 was on foot, stripped that it was even his essential work instrument and 
 War, the horse. </p>
<p>At the same time, some medium rural sectors linked to the oligarchy, emigrated 
 to Porto Alegre, they sought, in the face of their own economic decay and the growing 
 Americanization of the elite and the middle class of the capital, revalue a past 
 mythical. The values associated with the gaucho figure(coragem, solidariedade,
honra, altivez), however, they could only be effectively defended in the bulge of 
 a project of facing imperialism and landlord. This task fell 
 to labor, political force that united small and medium industrial and 
 traders, liberal professionals, sectors of the Armed Forces and, from 
 From the late 1950s, peasants with little or no land. </p>
<p>Jayme becomes a political militant while becoming a poet. Son 
 From the small bourgeoisie in the interior of the state, it identifies with the left wing 
 of the Brazilian Labor Party. Participates in Getúlio's campaigns(para a
Presidência em 50), Leonel Brizola, Rui Ramos and Alberto Pasqualini. Defended 
 the gaucho traditions understanding that the threat to them came from penetration 
 imperialist and that, to save them, the basic reforms were urgent 
 special to agrarian. </p>
<p>The question of the earth, by the way, permeates all his work. Missionary, has as 
 recurring reference Sepé Tiaraju, the leader of the Guarani resistance to the invasion 
 in the eighteenth century, whose defeat is the ancestral origin of the problem 
 Agrarian in Rio Grande do Sul: </p>
<p>“I could not stop the vacancy of Andonega and Barbacena./ If the story does not condemn them, 
 The stain never goes out!/ Oppression never asks in its petty ambition./ 
 It was my all I had, it was my all that was,/ and I died because I said 
 That that land was mine!”He wrote in <strong> _ Payada _ </strong>. </p>
<p>What is being gaucho? </p>
<p>The defense of the cultural roots of Rio Grande do Sul and the 
 resistance emerged in the 1940s have points in common with an effort of equal 
 nature started in the northeast of the country, at the same time, by men like Aryan 
 Suassuna. Both movements seek to preserve popular manifestations front 
 the cultural invasion of USA, undertaken via Rio and São Paulo through 
 Television, radio and record labels stations. Both seek to overcome the split 
 between classical and popular art through the synthesis of these elements. And both 
 are born on the sidelines of the university and the press, which only recognized their 
 existence for the strong social repercussion they had. </p>
<p>The effort to collect and systematize data on the popular culture that 
 Suassuna held in Pernambuco was undertaken in Rio Grande do Sul by 
 men like Passion Côrtes and Barbosa Lessa, founders of the movement 
 Gaucho traditionalist(MTG)that, in its early days, was important 
 analogous to the Armorial Movement of Suassuna. However, MTG, as an institution, 
 over the years has suffered a stagnation process that has ended 
 subtract importance. The most vivid and authentic manifestations of culture 
 of the gaucho people were in the bulge of the movement, but outside the strict obedience to 
 your guidelines.
contradiction between its conservative wing and the progressive. Both have in common 
 the appreciation of the past and some symbols. But the way to understand them 
 differ them. While the conservative strand tends to framing the past, to 
 The progressive The past is history. And living history, full of oppression and 
 FIGHTS. The first is the defense of crystallized images, the second to 
 Principles. This contradiction increases as, by the social repercussion of the 
 movement, politicians and entrepreneurs become an opportunistic way to use 
 of the feeling of identity of the people of Rio Grande do Sul for their own benefit. </p>
<p>Jayme himself sang, especially at the beginning of his career, the 
 Traditional Cuisine and the Gaucho Cuisine(o mate, o arroz de
carreteiro, o lenço, a faca). But it has always denounced the misuse of these 
 symbols by oppressors to confuse the people. </p>
<p>“I ask: what ahead/ plant a yerba mate foot,/ as a sign of 
 combat/ in defense of a plant/ if the same hand that raises/ in those 
 considerations/ is the one that signs concessions/ in an unconscious flourish/ 
 Middle killers/ who do devastations? ”, Asked in <strong> _ spring _ </strong>. AND 
 In <strong> _ Blood Farrapo _ </strong>, written after the 1964 coup: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Today - want to be an employee, 
or worker, 
or city - or crop 
or rodeo, 
Before those who demean the work 
And the salary, 
If they force me to choose, I'll be back and skin!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poet and researcher </p>
<p>Poet-re-enactment of genius, interpreter of the wishes of his people, critic 
 Oppression exerted by the landlord and imperialism, Jayme has, in the south, 
 role equivalent to the Assaré Patativa in the Northeast. Only differs from 
 because, even as a result of the objective conditions of the 
 medium in which I lived, had greater access to classical culture, even as as 
 Self -taught - First through the father, primary teacher, then as a director 
 of the Public Library in the Brizola government. Example of this is the poem <strong> _ chimarrão 
 and poetry _ </strong>, dotted from references to Greek and medieval poetry. </p>
<p>Jayme also had a solid knowledge of history and geography, 
 mainly from your region. Historical references are one of the brands of 
 his work and base the denunciation of the oppression to which the gaucho is subjected: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My corner is Rio, 
My corner is sun, 
My corner is wind, 
I have homeland, 
I have cradle, 
I have glory. 
I just don't have </p>
<p>Because the story 
that I wrote 
Dened me on the will!" 
<strong> __ </strong> </p>
<p>_ Terra were born screams, _ by Jayme Caetano Braun. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to being a poet, he was a researcher of gaucho folklore. Had special interest 
 by the champion medicine, the herbs -based medicines used by the Indians(carqueja, quebra-pedra). Even wrote a book, <strong> _ Pampean vocabulary 
 - Patrias, stoves and subtitles _ </strong>, about the traditions of the state. </p>
<p>This formation did not free him from the prejudice of the elites against popular art. In 
 Answer, wrote the verses of <strong> _ Identity _ </strong>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Half a dozen impostors 
Folklorist folding 
And walk - even if AngoLists 
Ciscating in the corridors 
with teacher acronyms 
who adopted by decree 
call me illiterate - 
I accept the definition, 
But I have the adverse possession 
That gives me the dialect!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regional, national, continental </p>
<p>Jayme's cultural and political militancy was not limited to Rio's borders 
 Grande do Sul or Brazil. From the 1960s, the culture begins to study 
 gaucho from Argentina and Uruguay and close contacts with artists of those 
 Countries, such as Uruguayan Sandalio Santos, his friend. </p>
<p>It was through these contacts that found the form of expression in which 
 It was left: the _payada, _ art of composing and declareing improvisation of rhymes 
 intertwined, usually in tenths and to the sound of guitar. Of Iberian origin, 
 born in the Uruguayan campaign in the 19th century, Payada is the gaucho equivalent of 
 Suddenly northeastern. Just like this, can be improvised in duet, in a game of 
 questions and answers, variant called Payada de counterpoint, which is equivalent 
 to the challenge of the Northeast singers. Jayme was the first and most important 
 Brazilian payador. </p>
<p>Poet and researcher Antonio Augusto Fagundes, one of the greatest connoisseurs of 
 gaucho culture, says, in an article published in the newspaper Galpão Crioulo when 
 Jayme's death, the impression that caused him to see him faces in a payada of 
 Counterpoint with Sandal Santos and Argentine Cayetano Daglio in Porto Alegre, 
 In 1962, during a traditionalist congress. </p>
<p>In his struggle in defense of Latin American cultural identity, Jayme 
 honored in moving verses( _ <strong>Don Atahualpa</strong>_ )Argentine Atahualpa 
 Yupanqui, whom he had as an idol, and even wrote poems in Spanish. 
 For him, there was no inconsistency between this approach and his posture of 
 Firefly Defender of Riograndense and Brazilian Culture. After all, Argentines and
They lost sense smaller rivalries. </p>
<p>While valuing the gaucho's heroism and its importance for the 
 definition of Brazil's borders in the nineteenth -century's platinum wars, one of the 
 main motives of traditionalism, defended the unity among the peoples of the 
 South America, especially the “three gaucho homeland”(Brasil, Argentina,
Uruguai). The poems of your book _ <strong> Landy landscapes </strong> _ contains numerous 
 References to Cultural Manifestations RIOPLATEMS such as _ <strong> Martín Fierro </strong> <em>, 
 the Argentine national poem. In poem t _ <strong> res gauchos </strong> </em>, synthesized this 
 ideal: </p>
<p>“Hermanos de Sembra y Paz,/ America is Tu Black!/ Ayer - Hycimos Frontera,/ 
 Hoy- No there we want bad. </p>
<p>Jayme also received honors like this. In _ <strong> Lost Landscapes </strong> <em>, 
 transcribes a poem by Sandalio Santos written in thanks for his book 
 _ <strong> homeland, stoves and subtitles </strong> </em>. More recently, in Brazil, the repentist 
 Potiguar Geraldo do Norte, on his album _ <strong> Northeastern Diploma </strong> <em>(2000), 
 recorded a poem titled _ <strong> Tribute to Jayme Caetano Braun </strong> </em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong> from the land were born screams </strong> </p>
<p>Killed my infinite 
And they expelled me from the fields; 
From the land were born screams, 
From the screams sprouted corners!</p>
<p>And I made myself singing 
Tropeiros and herb 
Tearing grooves, 
With plow and Saraquá; 
In the "barter" alpargatas 
and "Chibeiros", 
I walked the leagues 
Corrientes and Aceguá!</p>
<p>My corner is Rio, 
My corner is sun, 
My corner is wind, 
I have homeland, 
I have cradle, 
I have glory, 
I just don't have </p>
<p>Because the story 
That I wrote, 
Dened me on the will!</p>
<p>Anyway - 
Well or bad, 
I don't get emotional, 
With those who fight 
The truths of 
My corner; 
Without having the right to eat, 
Not what I plant, 
I just don't understand, 
Is so much land 
And little owner!</p>
<p>But even so, 
I have to give, 
The other so much, 
If you need my blood 
In another war; 
Even without land, 
I will return to scream from land, 
By the miracle 
From the ears of my corner </p>

 I haven't done it. It is not easy to get rented housing in Trondheim without fixed 
 Income, while not talking so good Norwegian. ” </p>
<p>The previous lease for the municipal apartment expired last year, and 
 She then applied for a new extension based on a change in the guidelines for

 of their class dictatorship(suurporvariston ja maanomistajien diktatuuria), using 
 de facto either military governments or government boards, 
 so -called constitutional governments. </p>
<p>The crisis of peak layers is clearly evident now that we live in a revolutionary 
 in the development of the situation. Lenin has masterfully characterized by three</p>
<p>muuttumattomana; vallitsee jonkinlainen 'huippukerrosten' kriisi, hallitsevan
luokan politiikan kriisi, se synnyttää halkeaman, johon tunkeutuu sorrettujen
luokkien tyytymättömyys ja suuttumus. Vallankumouksen alkamista varten ei
tavallisesti riitä se, että 'pohjakerrokset eivät tahdo', vaan sitä varten on
välttämätöntä vielä se, että 'huippukerrokset eivät voi elää vanhaan tapaan.
2)The escalation of the lack and misery of oppressed classes 
 More seemingly. 3(II Internationalen vararikko). </p>
<p>The development of the situation in the country shows that that crisis of the top layers now opens up 
 indeed a crack that penetrates the dissatisfaction of oppressed classes and 
 anger. It's a fact that troops have started day by day 
 more powerful opposition such as last year's cost of living and prices 
 As you rise. Troops are stepping into the turmoil, all this weak and 
 during the failed government, as was the Castillo government that does not 
 completed and could not fill out their election promises. But the situation doesn't change much 
 From the point of view of the recession, its difficulties only increase. This is good 
 to a revolution, it is good for advancing a party's general 
 reorganization in the Folk War and for the Folk War. This 
 in situations like, as government changes, knowing that a new government 
 be much worse for troops, it is essential to mobilize the battle, 
 the rights, freedoms and benefits of troops conquered with blood 
 defending it to be lifted into a political battle. It is 
 task in order to fill in the party's general reorganization 
 delayed task and would continue to develop the New Democratic 
 Revolution in the Folk War. </p>
<p>Regarding class content that is raised by revisionism and opportunism 
 with the emblems of "new elections and referendum enforcement of the Constitution 
 Meeting and a new Constitution ": </p>
<p>Marxism is of the fact that elections must be used for propaganda and 
 for agitation, and revisionists are against this, supporting the election 
 use to overcome parliamentary positions, to serve the old state 
 restructuring, seeking to repair an old and rabbing state, 
 to use its centralized force to fight the revolution. 
 This is a class content in those criteria that all kinds of revisionists, 
 mainly ool-movadef do in all forms, spreading their message 
 In the legitimate protests of the troops, singing and dancing. </p>
<p>Should not be forgotten that revisionism in Peru used a party to concentrate it 
 to the elections and raised the governments of Prado and Bustamente, representing 
 comprador bourgeois; later the first government of Belaunde, representing 
 bureaucratic bourgeois; later they supported Velazco and Alán Garcia 
 first government, bureaucrats. </p>
<p>In the 2021 General Elections, they used their champion Jorge del Pradon 
 means. They lifted the counter -revolutionary Opportunist Rondero Pedro 
 Castillo's government power, Perú Libre acting as an umbrella. Perú Libre is 
 The property of the Cerrón family. This Pedro Castillo Terrones genocide 
 As part of the Regional Regulations, Bellido and Minister of Labor Iber 
 Maraví(OOL), they performed the role of the executor, with the execution of the execution 
 For the biggest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, chairman of the current period 
 Gonzaloon, the great leader of the party. </p>
<p>Marxism has taught us to use the elections as propaganda and 
 as an agitation, in our case, to use them for the development of the folk war 
 good, currently fulfilling the party's general reorganization 
 task, crushing the revisionism in the People's War and for the People's War. </p>
<p>To curb the action of troops, they are attracted to "defend 
 democracy "and" to defend millions of voting "," by referendum 
 elected president. " 
 on behalf of ". Thus they act to shape the corporate state, 
 In a racing battle with another fraction, a large bourgeois comprador fraction 
 with. In a racing battle leading to breeding against the people 
 Repression. As we see the events of these days. </p>
<p>This is what has to be made clear to the troops. There is a plan that 
 revisionists, opportunists and career politicians and all the other 
 meet to maintain the old order. They are responsible 
 genocide, hunger, misery and the sale of the country to imperialism. They 
 come to stick to the plan because they have an opportunistic self 
 The attitude of the sale without which they would not be opportunists. Individuals change,
The lawyer exists and will be until it sinks because of the bourgeois 
 And imperialists need it and capitalism gives birth to it. Therefore that 
 is the defense of the old order, it focuses on being a supporter, to be 
 Election enthusiasts [Electoristas], and today its actions is a folk war 
 Against, focusing on the desire to liquidate PKP. </p>
<p>Earth's events should serve Dina Boluarte's new genocide 
 the disclosure of the regulation and should at the same time help 
 to reveal revisionism and its failed genocide 
 the regulation of the recession led by an opportunist Rondero Castillo and his 
 his servant ool revisionist and capitalist, and Perú Libre, 
 Movadefin, Fenateperún, "Teachers Blokin"(vuoden 2017 lakot)and 
 the revisionist band of all types of rats, as well as its ear -like 
 revisionist flag "the battle for referendum on the Constitution 
 for a adjusting meeting and for a new constitution that is seeking an old state 
 Restructuring in order to fulfill three of their recession. </p>
<p>The class struggle is escalating and there is a greater need to fight. 
 The troops are ready for battle. </p>
<p>Folk war, exceeded a complex and difficult situation after 
 Chairman Gonzalo and some of the leadership became prisoner of war. Later 
 the revisionist and capitalist right-wing collection line(OOL)rats made fraud for the revolutionary war and began to serve 
 CIA and Peru's recession "Peace Letters" nonsense, to destroy PKP and 
 Folk War. These rats began to attack Chairman Gonzalo, the party 
 and against the great leader of the revolution, and gave up Marxism-Leninism- 
 Maoism, Gonzalo's thinking. This situation raises the need for PKP general 
 reorganization to lead the People's War. </p>
<p>In the middle of complex situations of Peru -Communists must meet 
 Urgent and delayed task of the party's general reorganization. 
 This situation has reflective effects on troops' battle and even more 
 a world situation where we face a new episode of revolutions, which 
 with the great explosiveness and activity of troops, such as the chairman 
 Gonzalo has taught. </p>
<p>Correspondingly, we must reinstate the chairman of ourselves 
 In Gonzalo's great leadership and omnipotent in Gonzalo's thinking 
 to fulfill the task, to develop the folk war in order to be culminated 
 Proletariat -led democratic revolution, neo -democratic 
 a revolution that is a forming, fundamental and crucial part of the whole 
 the world's proletarian revolution. </p>
<p>The explosiveness of the troops intensifies on all fronts. Peru is dissatisfaction 
 the land labeled, and it will grow even further, it occurs when 
 A government led by Pedro Castillo Terrones 
 Slavored and parliamentary citizens on Bolívar Square as pigs. 
 Dissatisfaction also manifests itself in how troops oppose Dina Boluarten 
 A new genocide of the decline. A situation that a recession and 
 Revisionism use in their reactionary racing battle, lead 
 to a larger repression against the people and compare against troops. 
 Opposition to Dina Boluarte's Folklore Regulation and Peru Old 
 Repressing by the state genocide repression forces. Resistance 
 Declaration of Emergency by this Regulation Board and the handling 
 with different pretexts of genocide armed forces. </p>
<p>President Gonzalo has said to us as he progresses to the current one 
 to the situation: </p>
<p>"Would the troops come despair? They give birth to spontaneous movements that 
 are dangerous because they can be misused, useful regarding it, 
 that is able to awaken the troops more need to fight and our 
 our obligation to take a clear to this explosive situation and use it 
 According to class and people's own interests, for the benefit of the People's War. " </p>
<p>Opportunists and revisionists, mainly revisionist and 
 Capitoistist ool do the opposite, they pretend to raise 
 troops using an election car and a "constitutional meeting of a new 
 for the constitution "to serve their beloved imperialists and 
 the benefits of recession. The task of communists is to fight hopeless 
 against opportunists, but not condemned for troops, we cannot say that 
 The troops are opportunists. Because they have been deceived we need to get them 
 to open their eyes and see, reality is a good teacher, it is a crisis or 
 class struggle that is stronger every day, the present genocide 
 Boluarte government's same recession violence, all this helps 
 troops to understand, but not enough to understand through the negative, 
 but have to be understood through a positive 
 There is a need to do and what is the course you need to follow. </p>
